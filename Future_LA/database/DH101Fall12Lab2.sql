The first phase, thg \r\nresults of which are contained herein, relates to the I\'nagmtude of potential \r\npassenger traffic and revenue of such a system, and tentat1ve routing of the \r\nrail line, The second phase wi 11 cove r those aspects relating to general \r\ndesirn characteristics of the ra,l cars and supporting structures, and of the \r\ninvestment and bond S Pflong estHuates, \r\n\r\nCO CLUSIONS \r\n\r\n1. \r\nFor a practIcal, high speedl, light weIght, attractive and convenient rail \r\npassenger line operating be-tween the Los Angeles International Airport \r\n~ \r\nand downtown trITllnal 1n Los An €,les. wlth a branch LJne 1nto the \r\nWilshi re Bouleva I\'d Area. the source s of passenge r t raffi c would be: \r\n\r\nA-1 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na \r\nDiverSlon of pass.engers who would otherwIse use the \r\nal rport bus line o,n the downtown rout.e. \r\n\r\nb. \r\nDl.version of passengers who would otherwise use \r\nautomobiles to an.d from the ai rport. \r\nc. \r\nInduced new tra£f:lc that would not otherwise use either \r\nof those modes of; travel. \r\n2. \r\nIt is estimated that. potential annuaJ traffic from these three sources for \r\nthe year 1965, would be\'. \r\ndo.

In \r\ngeneral. however there are thr e prospective routings that appear to have \r\nmerit, as follows: \r\na. Easterly from the a~ \r\nport along Century Boulevard to the \r\nHarbor Freeway, thence north on the freeway into the \r\ndowntown area. \r\nb.

Local Alrport Statistlcs \r\nSection HI page B-2, shows that there were 285 Industries \r\nlocated Wlthm a one-mile radius of the airport, with 75 leaseholders at \r\nthe airport with total employment of 32 .. 000 persons. At the time of this \r\nsurvey there were 17 airlines using the ai rport w~th \r\ntwo addltionaI lines \r\nexpected In the nea r future This magnitude of act vity provIdes a substantial \r\nmeasure of potential airport raIl line patronage. \r\n7. Forecast of Ai dine Pas sengers \r\nUnder sectlon IV on page B··2, there are shown the results of a \r\nlong range pred:ction of airlme passenger tr\'affic extendIng from 1956 \r\nthrough 1970. These estimates were prepared by the Aviation ServIce \r\nCompany and s ubmi tted to the Los Angele s Depa rtment of Al rports in \r\nFebruary 1956. \r\nThree bases of estimating were submitted as shown In the three \r\ncolumns of the t.able. The first was tern1ed a \"conservative\" estirnate, \r\nthe second a \"supportable\'! estimate. and the third a \"not iInprobable\" \r\n< \r\nestimate. It is interesting to note that colun1n (4) of the table shows that \r\n, actual traffic over the penod of five years from 1956 through 1960 showed \r\nu \r\n\r\nannual increases in excess of the \'not Improbable\'! estImate, with exception \r\nof the year 1958. \r\n\r\nA 19 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n)f thjs ac.tlJal pattern con lnued, certainly the conservallve estimate \r\nWJll be r ached and)t lS qwte lIkely t.hat the supportable estimate \r\nwill be reached Under favorable conditions the past trend may continue \r\nwith a rate of growth that wJU equal, 1£ not exceed the third estimate as \r\nshown on the table. It JS reasonable to expect that the trend of alrport \r\nrail passengers w)11 continue upward if the volume of ai r15ne passenger \r\ntraffIC £ollows the predlcted trend. \r\n\r\nActually, there is a probability that the trend of growth on the \r\nrail line ml ght exceed the t !:\'end of growth on the ai dines, Th] s could \r\nwell be brought about as a result of the rapldly lncreasing vehIcular \r\ntraffic congestion 1n the vlclnity of the alrpo t and on Clty streets which, \r\nas it worsens. will tend to d),scourage that m.ode of travel for airline \r\npassengers They will virtually be forced to seek some other means of \r\ntravel and a well-desIgned elevated rapld transit i\'ne will SOlVE their \r\nproblem, providing It offe s destination points that are reasonably convenient \r\nt.o the ai rhne passengers. \r\n\r\n8, Automotive Train c \r\n\r\nTo any person uSlng the anEnes and to those visiting the airport, \r\nit is obvious that a great volume of passenger t.raffic \'s carried by automobiles \r\ninto and out of the airport confines. At the present time, a \r\nrelatively small percentage of the tolal airline traffl C gets to and from the \r\nairport by mass transit faClhties. By far the greater portion rehes upon \r\nthe private a utOl\'nobl1e . \r\n\r\n.. \r\n\r\nu \r\n\r\n~ \r\n\r\n\r\nU In addition to the aIrline passengers themselves. these automo\r\n\r\n\r\no\r\n\r\n..\'-,\r\n\r\n< \r\n\r\nbiles car ry persons employed at the al rport. relatives and £rj ends of the \r\nairline passengers and many visitors.

The 168 page report, officially known as \"Report to the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transit Authority on a Monorail Rapid Transit Line for Los Angeles\" dated January 15, 1954 by Coverdale & Colpitts, Gibbs & Hill, Inc. and Ruscardon Engineers, contained three parts: economic feasbilility of the monorail system by Coverdale & Colpitts; traffic, population and economic data by Ruscardon Engineers; and monorail system design estimates of construction costs and operating expenses by Gibbs & Hill.  The proposed system was featured in the July 1954 issue of Fortune magazine in an article entitled \"Anyone for Monorail?\" which explained both the engineering and local politics of the time.    \r\nLAMTA (1951-1964) was originally formed to study a monorail line along the Los Angeles River from Long Beach to Panorama City.  The State expanded LAMTA\'s mandate to include countywide mass transit planning in any mode it found feasible.  It\'s mandate was further expanded in 1958 to to include operation of the existing transit system.  When Alweg and Goodell monorail companies both created system plans and offered to build monorail systems for Los Angeles with revenue bond funding only, a public firestorm ensued that the nascent LAMTA was unprepared for. The Wilshire corridor and Beverly Hills, as well as the Valley Boulevard Corridor, vehemently opposed any overhead system.  LAMTA had its own plan which included subway along Wilshire.  Without subsidies, eminent domain, and an unpopular 7 member board appointed by the Governor, LAMTA was replaced by the Southern California Rapid Transit District in 1964 via legislation sponsored by State Senator Rees (D-Beverly Hills).  \r\nMonorail cars are designed to travel under the tracks. Includes a \'Master Plan\' of Freeways (p. 166)\r\n\r\nThe proposal suggests a monorail rapid transit line between the San Fernando Valley and Long Beach.\r\n\r\n\'This report is made to the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transit Authority pursuant to the declared policy of the State of California to develop interurban rapid transit systems in various metropolitan areas of the State for the benefit of the people.

J. Eyraud, Chairman \r\n\r\nGentlemen: \r\n\r\nOn behalf of Goodell !4onoral1 Systems, Inc. of Los Angeles \r\nand its affiliate, Goodell Monorail, Inc., (Goodell Monorail) and \r\non behalf of Paine, Webber, Jackson & Curtis (paine, Webber), we \r\npropose to finance, design, build, erect and equip a two way Goodell \r\nMonorail Airport-Type Suspended System from the Los Angeles International \r\nAirport to a point adjacent to the Harbor Freeway in downtown \r\nLos Angeles to be designated by the Authority. \r\n\r\nBackground of the Proposal \r\n\r\nEarly in 1959, Goodell Monorail contacted the Executive \r\nDirector of the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) to discuss \r\nGoodell Monorail\'s proposal for a mass rapid transit system for \r\nLos Angeles. \r\n\r\nSince that date, more than three years ago, Murel Goodell \r\nand other members of the engineering staff of Goodell Monorail have \r\nmaintained a close working relationship with MTA staff and \r\ncommittees 1n a step-by-step development of a system Which was being \r\npartiCUlarly designed for installation 1n the Los Angeles area. \r\n\r\n-1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA subsequent meeting with the MTA Engineering Committee \r\nin 1959 developed a number of engineering and operational questions \r\nwhich Goodell Monorail was in the process of answering on November \r\n3, 1959, when your Authority retained the engineering firm of \r\nDaniel, Mann, Johnson and Mendenhall (DMJM) as independent Engineering \r\nConsultants to the Authority. \r\n\r\nThe MTA then issued a general invitation to all proponents \r\nof mass rapid transit systems to submit their plans for review by \r\nthe MTA engineers. \r\n\r\nGoodell Monorail was among those who responded to the MTA \r\ninvitation. During October, 1959, it submitted to the Authority \r\nspecifications for the Goodell equipment, including track construction \r\nand automatic control. As a consequence, engineering \r\nconstruction and operational features of the Goodell Monorail system \r\nwere disclosed. The primary objective of the Authority survey, at \r\nthat time, was to find the best equipment and system for a hlghcapacity, \r\nmass rapid transit commuter installation, which later \r\nbecame identified as the \'~A \r\nBACKBONE ROUTE.\" During the DMJM \r\nreview, it became apparent that the Goodell Monorail Airport type \r\nequipment was particularly adaptable to a low-capacity, high-speed \r\nservice, such as that which would be required to serve between the \r\nLos Angeles International Airport and downtown Los Angeles. In the \r\ntwo years since that time, Goodell Monorail engineers have, in a \r\ncareful step-by-step program, developed an attractive light-weight, \r\nconvenient and fast system to be considered for installation \r\n\r\nbetween the airport and downtown Los Angeles. \r\n\r\n-2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSince our first meeting in 1959~ \r\nGoodell Monorail \r\n\r\nprincipals have met with the MTA staff on 26 occasions. \r\n\r\nOn October 24, 1961, Goodell Monorail Systems, Inc. presented \r\nto the Engineering Committee of the Authority its engineering \r\nreport and an independent economic feasibility report by \r\nArthur C. Jenkins & Associates, nationally recognized transit and \r\ntransportation authority. The Engineering Committee instructed the \r\nAuthority Cpief Engineer and the Executive Director to continue \r\ndevelopmental work. \r\n\r\nThereafter we caused a further independent engineering \r\nfeasibility report to be prepared by John A. Houseman & Associates. \r\nThis report was filed with and discussed with the Authority\'s Chief \r\nEngineer and staff. \r\n\r\nThe system has also been declared feasible from an \r\nengineering standpoint by the Authority\'s own Chief Engineer, Mr. \r\nErnest Gerlach. \r\n\r\nRecognizing that the Metropolitan Transit Authority Act \r\nrequires that the Authority \"pay 1ts own way, \" we were aware that \r\nany proposal for construction and operation of an airport-type \r\nrapid transit system had to include a self-liquidating rinanclng \r\nprogram. \r\n\r\nIn view of this, Goodell Monorail consulted with Paine, \r\nWebber, Jackson & Curtis, one of the country\'s leading investment \r\nand underwriting firms, for the purpose of developing a plan for \r\nthe independent financing of the proposed system. Jointly, Goodell \r\nMonorail and Paine, Webber retained and have paid substantial \r\n\r\n-3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namounts to the firm of Arthur C. Jenkins & Associates for the \r\n\r\npurpose of preparing an independent economic feasibility study of \r\n\r\nthe proposed Goodell Monorail Airport system. \r\n\r\nBased upon the gratifying conclusions contained in this \r\n\r\nreport, Paine, Webber determined to form an underwriting syndicate \r\n\r\nto purchase from the Authority its revenue bonds sufficient in \r\n\r\namount to completely finance the proposed system. \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the proposal we are making to your Authority \r\n\r\ntoday is a joint proposal of Goodell Monorail with respect to the \r\n\r\nconstruction of the system and of Paine, Webber with respect to the \r\n\r\ncomplete financing thereof. The terms of the financial proposals \r\n\r\nare a part hereof. \r\n\r\nThe proposal submitted to you hereby is, therefore, a \r\n\r\njoint proposal of Goodell Monorail and the firm of Paine, Webber, \r\n\r\nJackson & Curtis to finance, build and deliver on a I~urn \r\nkey\" basis \r\n\r\nto the Metropolitan Transit Authority a complete system connecting \r\n\r\nthe International Airport to downtown Los Angeles. \r\n\r\nCo-operation of Others \r\n\r\nIn making this proposal, we recognize that there are other \r\npublic agencies not only Vitally concerned but with particular \r\nresponsibilities 1n connection with the right-of-way that would be \r\nrequired for the installation of the proposed system. It is recognized \r\nthat this project can only be completed with the full cooperation \r\nof Metropolitan Transit Authority, the City and County \r\nof Los Angeles) the City of Inglewood) the Los Angeles Airport \r\nCommission and the state of California Department of Public Works, \r\nDivision of Highways. \r\n\r\n-4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCharacteristics of the Proposed System \r\n\r\nGeneral \r\n\r\nThe proposal contemplates a two way airport-type monorail \r\n\r\nsystem with cars suspended from \"T\" shaped columns supporting a \r\n\r\nmonorail on each arm. It is a light-weight, high-speed alrport\r\n\r\n\r\ntype transit system designed to meet requirements for safety of \r\n\r\noperation and passenger capacity. \r\n\r\nThe Route \r\n\r\nThe within proposal is based upon an approximate 17 mile \r\nroute from the Los Angeles International Airport along Century \r\nBoulevard to the Harbor Freeway, thence along the edge of the \r\nHarbor Freeway right-of-way to a point in downtown Los Angeles \r\nadjacent to the Harbor Freeway to be designated by the Authority, \r\nor along such alternate route as may be mutually acceptable to the \r\nparties. \r\nThe Passenger Coaches \r\n\r\nThe initial system would be comprised of 11 light-weight, \r\nfully automated, high-speed, television monitored, heated and air \r\nconditioned cars. Each car would accommodate 28 passengers. Nine \r\nsuch cars, each with baggage capacity, will together provide an \r\naggregate maximum normal one way passenger capacity of 400 seated \r\npersons per hour. One coach will be designated for standby duty, \r\nand one coach is classified as an automatic inter-airline terminal \r\ntransfer coach available for making a closed circle operation \r\nretween tnd.1viclual airline passenger terminals. \r\n\r\n-5\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNoise \r\n\r\nThe noise level inside and outside the Goodell Monorail \r\ncoaches is no greater than that of most modern passenger elevators \r\nmanufactured today. \r\nAir Conditioning \r\n\r\nEach coach will be equipped with 8 ton capacity air \r\nconditioning to maintain air at 750 f,d.b. with 50% relative \r\nhumidity when outside air is 950 f.d.b. and 780 f.w.b. \r\nHeating \r\n\r\nThe heating system for each coach 1s capable of 100,000 \r\nBTU/hr., which will maintain 750 F. car temperature when outside \r\nair temperature is 00 F. \r\nBack~round \r\nMusic \r\n\r\nEach coach will be equipped with high fidelity background \r\nmusic for passenger enjoyment. \r\nBaggage \r\n\r\nThere will be built in each car quickly detachable porteroperated \r\nmobile baggage pods for airmail and packages, \r\nPropulsion \r\n\r\nIn recognition of the possible air contamination problem, \r\nthe system will provide for electric propulsion -each car equipped \r\nwith four 100 h.p. traction motors and dynamic braking. The system \r\nshall be designed for 600v DC transmission operation. Included in \r\nthis proposal are seven 750 k.w. silicon diode rectifier substation \r\nunits with the capacity to maintain operation of 22 coaches. \r\n\r\n-6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBody and Hanger Arm Design \r\n\r\nThe traction chassis unit and hanger arm are of high alloy \r\ngrade cast aluminum design. The coach is of aircraft type construction. \r\nDoor operation will be comparable to full automatic \r\nmodern elevator doors. \r\nColumns \r\n\r\nRails and Columns. Rails and columns are of streamlined \r\ndesign, fabricated from A-36 grade welded steel. \r\n\r\n\r\nFoundations. Each foundation is particularly designed to \r\nsuit local conditions and generally wherever possible sonic driven \r\npiling clusters. \r\nOperations \r\n\r\nSpeed. Each coach is designed for normal operating speeds \r\nof approximately 90 miles per hour on level and tangent track. \r\nAcceleration. Designed for 4 MPH/SEC at maximum load and \r\nnormal track conditions. \r\nDeceleration. Designed for normal rate of 3.0 MPH/SEC \r\nand an emergency rate of 5.9 MPH/SEC. \r\nCar Coupling. Cars may be operated independently or in \r\ntandem as determined by traffic requirements. \r\n\r\nAutomation. All coach operation will normally be in a \r\npredetermined circle as to acceleration, normal running time J \r\ndeceleration, station stops and loading. The central station \r\noperator who will observe coach pattern through television equipment \r\nwill regulate headway time, seat capacity per car and \r\nelectrically place into system operation additional coaches from \r\nstorage yal\'d rail parking track. \r\n\r\n-7\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSafet~ \r\n\r\n\r\nThe fUlly automated system provides independent check and \r\ndouble check circuits for Fail-Safe operation. In addition, closed \r\ncircuit television monitoring permits the Chief Operator to override \r\nautomatic controls if necessary. \r\nTechnical Requirements \r\n\r\nThe proposed system has been designed to conform to \r\napplicable codes, insurance requirements, safety requirements and \r\nother local requirements relative to operations, detailed data \r\nrespecting which are already in the Authority\'s files. \r\nTerminals \r\n\r\nPassenger loading facilities of functional and aesthetic \r\ndesign would be provided at the airport and at a location adjacent \r\nto the Harbor Freeway in downtown Los Angeles. \r\n\r\nCost of the Proposed System \r\n\r\nIt is proposed that the system shall be delivered and the \r\nfinancing paid for at a price of approximately Forty Million Dollars \r\n($40,000,000.00) subject to appropriate adjustments depending upon \r\n\r\n(1) the final route and the location, type and cost of terminal \r\npoints and station facilities as determined by the Authority, (2) \r\nthe initial number of cars, and (3) certain other engineering \r\ndecisions With respect to alternate equipment and facilities. \r\nThe Contract \r\n\r\nThe proposal contemplates that a definitive construction \r\ncontract will be executed between the Authority and Goodell Monorail \r\nSystems, Inc. to build an Airport Type Monorail system having the \r\n\r\n-8\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncharacteristics set forth above along the route and at the cost \r\n\r\nspecified. The proposal further contemplates that on completion \r\n\r\nthe system will be fully equipped and ready for regular and full \r\n\r\noperation -in others words, a \"turn keylt job. \r\n\r\nCompletion Time \r\n\r\nIt is proposed that the foregoing system will be completed \r\nwithin 18 months from the date on which the Authority has provided \r\nrights-of-way and all other rights pertaining thereto and following \r\nthe execution of a definitive construction contract and bond indenture \r\nproviding for the financing of the system. Work under the \r\ncontract shall be commenced and we shall proceed therewith with due \r\ndiligence promptly following the execution of the contract and upon \r\ndelivery of proper completion bonds. \r\n\r\nProgress payments shall be made on the contract price in \r\naccordance with a schedule satisfactory to the Authority and to the \r\nundersigned. \r\n\r\nFinancing, \r\n\r\nPaine, Webber, hereby proposes with respect to the matters \r\nrelating to financing of the project contemplated within this joint \r\nproposal of Goodell Monorail and Paine, Webber as follows: \r\n\r\nA. Paine, Webber proposes to form an underwriting group \r\nto enter into a definitive underwriting agreement (hereinafter \r\nreferred to as \"the II or \"said Underwriting Agreement\") in forr.1 and \r\nsubstance to be mutually satisfactory to the ~ITA \r\nand Paine, Webber \r\nwhich will provide for the purchase by Paine, Webber and the underwriting \r\ngroup from the MTA of revenue bonds to be financed from the \r\n-9\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noperation of the airport-type monorail system herein described in \r\nthe approximate aggregate principal sum of Forty Million Dollars \r\n($40,000,000.00); and \r\n\r\nB. Paine, Webber further proposes that the bond proceeds \r\nhereinabove mentioned will provide the funds necessary for the \r\nfollowing: \r\n(1) The construction and completion of the \r\nairport-type monorail system described in this joint \r\nproposal, including all necessary and incidental \r\nfacilities such as coaches, automation equipment, etc., \r\nso as to cause the entire system to be delivered to \r\nAuthority in a complete and operable conditionj \r\n(2) The construction and completion of the \r\nterminal facilities at both ends of the system to \r\nthe extent that said facilities are described in the \r\nconstruction proposal and feasibility reports herein \r\ncontained or referred to; \r\n(3) The funding of monies sufficient to meet \r\nthe interest requirements of the bonds for a suitable \r\nperiod of time covering the period of construction and \r\nearly period of operation of the system; \r\n(4) All financing costs including printing of the \r\nbonds and Official statement respecting their sale and \r\nissuance, legal opinions respecting the validity of \r\nthe issuance of the bonds, and bond discount; \r\n(5) All incidental costs related to the construction \r\nof the facilities hereinabove referred to, \r\n-10\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincluding engineering, legal, financial, incidentals \r\nand contingencies; and \r\n\r\nC. Paine, Webber acknowledges that it may be necessary \r\nin order to assure the construction and operation of the airporttype \r\nmonorail system for the Authority to acquire certain incidental \r\nrights-of-way and a terminal site in the downtown Los Angeles area \r\nand the existing franchise permitting the operation of the airport \r\nservice bus system now operating between the airport and downtown \r\nLos Angeles. In this regard, Paine, l1ebber further proposes that \r\nin order to provide such additional funds as may be reasonably \r\nrequired for these purposes the aggregate principal sum of the \r\nrevenue bonds herein mentioned may be increased to the extent \r\neconomically feasible so as to exceed the aforementioned sum of \r\nForty Million Dollars ($40,000,000.00); and \r\nD. Paine, Webber further proposes that the Underwriting \r\nAgreement and/or the terms of the bond indenture shall, among \r\nother things, provide for the following to the mutual satisfaction \r\nof Paine, Webber and the Authority: \r\n(1) Adequate provision will be made so that the \r\ntotal gross revenues obtained from the operation of \r\nthe airport-type monorail system shall be applied to \r\nthe servicing and safeguarding of the underwriting; \r\n(2) All matters relating to the authority to \r\nenter into and execute the Underwriting Agreement, as \r\nwell as to the form and substance of the issuance by \r\nthe Authority of such revenue bonds, shall be subject \r\nto the mutual approval of Paine, Webber\'s and the \r\n-11\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAuthority\'s counsel; \r\n\r\n(3) All terms relating to the bond issue and \r\nmore specifically those defining the maturity schedule~ \r\nprice~ \r\nrate of lnterest~ \r\nthe proper segregation of \r\nfunds (as hereinbelow more specifically descr1bed)~ \r\nand terms of call and/or tender; \r\n(4) The segregation of the gross receipts received \r\nfrom the operation of the airport-type monorail system \r\ninto such funds as may be reasonably necessary and \r\nrequired under the circumstances. Examples of the funds \r\nherein referred to would be: \r\n(a) Constructjon Fund; \r\n(b) Revenue Fund; \r\n(c) Operation Fund; \r\n(d) Interest Fund; \r\n(e) Bond Retirement Fund; \r\n(f) Sinking Fund; \r\n(g) Bond Reserve Fund; \r\n(h) Depreciation Reserve Fund; \r\n(i) General Fund; and \r\nE. Palne J Webber further proposes that the revenue bonds \r\nherein described shall be authorized by the Authority pursuant to \r\nproceedings as may be reasonably necessary so as to enable the \r\nAuthority to issue and sell such bonds separate and distinct from \r\nproceedings heretofore taken with respect to the bonds of the \r\nAuthority presently outstanding. It is further proposed that the \r\n-12\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMTA\'S revenues from its existing surface system should not be \r\nobligated in any way to service the bonds sold for the purpose of \r\npaying for the cost of the Goodell Monorail Airport-Type system \r\nas herein described. If it is decided by bond counsel that the \r\nfinancing cannot be done under a separate indenture because of \r\nthe terms of the indenture on the outstanding bonds or for other \r\nlegal reasons, Paine~ \r\nWebber proposes that the outstanding bonds \r\nbe refunded and a new indenture written that would allow either \r\nof the following: (a) separate financing of the airport-type \r\nmonorail system; or (b) that the fiuancing for the airport-type \r\nmonorail system be included in the single indenture of the refunding \r\nbonds. Whether the airport-type monorail system is \r\nfinanced under a separate indenture or combined with the refunding \r\nbonds must be determined to the mutual satisfaction of the Authority \r\nand Paine, Webber. \r\n\r\nEarly Acceptance \r\n\r\nWe recognize that between the time of your acceptance of \r\nthis proposal and the execution of the definitive contracts, \r\naction by you with other public authorities, particularly with \r\nreference to rights-of-way, is essential. To the end that this \r\nimportant project may be quickly brought to fruition, we urge \r\nyour prompt consideration of our proposal and respectfully \r\nrequest that the same be acted upon at your next regularly \r\nscheduled meeting. \r\n\r\nUpon your acceptance of the foregoing proposal, we will \r\nproceed promptly with you to the drafting and completion of the \r\n\r\n-13\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndefinitive terms of the necessary contracts specifying all details \r\nwithin the scope of this proposal, the terms of which contracts \r\nshall be acceptable to our respective counsel. \r\n\r\nVery truly yours, \r\nGOODELL MONORAIL SYSTEMS, INC. \r\n\r\n\r\nBy ~~=:-:-_-:;:-,,--;o;--..,... \r\n_ \r\n\r\nWilliam L.

The Concept is intended to serve\r\nas the basic framework for the Los Angeles\r\nGeneral Plan, which is scheduled to be completed\r\nby the end of 1970. The report is the\r\nfirst in a series of recommendations for the\r\nGeneral Plan.\r\nThe General Plan is the basic component of\r\nthe comprehensive planning process. Its purpose is to provide City officials with a guide\r\nfor decision making on planning and development matters and to inform the public of the expected future development of the City.\r\nThe proposals included in the Concept are\r\nintended to be ambitious and far reaching,\r\nlooking to the attainment of the full potential\r\nof Los Angeles. The Concept is designed to\r\nmeet the needs of a future city of five million\r\npeople. Other portions of the General Plan\r\nwill be more explicit and will be tied to\r\nspecific time periods. The Concept seeks to restructure the City in order to el iminate or alleviate cu rrent problems and anticipate and deal with future issues befo re they beco me seri ous problems. In the judgment of the Planning Department staff, the Concept would result in a physical structure consistent with the goals and objectives of the City\'s citizens, as expressed\r\nthrough the Goals Program and other planning\r\nresearch. Adoption and implementation of the General Plan is the responsibility of the elected\r\nofficials of the City - the Mayor and City\r\nCounci Imen. The future nature and form of\r\nLos Angeles must be determined by the\r\nrepresentatives of the citizens, not by special\r\ninterests either public or private.\r\n\r\nUnder the supervision of then-Planning Director Calvin Hamilton, the city’s planners set about developing a concept plan to deal with the city’s future growth. In 1970, after years of research and development, the city released \"Concept Los Angeles: The Concept for the Los Angeles General Plan\".\r\n\r\nKnow as the \"centers concept\", the main idea was bold and simple: concentrate high density development in a few established activity centers, connect these areas with rapid transit, and leave low-density areas alone. \r\n\r\nAdopted in 1974, the plan was supposed to lead to changes in the city’s zoning and subdivision codes, not to mention galvanize support for a rail transit system. Yet many elected officials and the public at large never bought into the ideas embodied in the plan. The city – with some exceptions due to political pressure or economic downturns – continued to follow the same growth paradigm. And though several rail transit lines were ultimately built, the city’s grand transit scheme was never realized.'),(2001,47,2,51,0,'Still Image'),(2000,47,2,42,0,'jpeg'),(1997,47,2,49,0,'Crowley, Aleister, 1875-1947.\r\nHubbard, L.

Each of these\r\nmeetings was attended by a member of\r\nthe SCRTD staff. The first meeting\r\nwas designed to acquaint city officials\r\nwith the purpose for the project,\r\nto assure them that they would\r\nhave an opportunity to react to any\r\ntransit changes affecting their\r\ncities before these were codified,\r\nand to obtain from them information\r\non travel patterns and transportation\r\nrequirements as they and the communities\r\nthat they represented perceive\r\nthem. At the second meeting the\r\nprincipal concepts of the plan were\r\npresented along with alternative\r\nideas for improving service. The\r\nreactions and suggestions from this\r\nsecond meeting are reflected in the\r\ntransit improvement plan.\r\nBesides the information and\r\ndata supplied by the cities and operators\r\nof the major shopping centers,\r\nthe evaluation of existing services\r\nused passenger check data and schedules\r\nsupplied by SCRTD and demographic\r\nand travel data from the 1970 U.S.\r\nCensus.\r\nSCRT~ TRANSIT IMPRUV~MENT PROGR<1M...\r\nThe plan for improving transit\r\nservices in the Mid-Cities area is\r\npart of a comprehensive Short Range\r\nTransit Improvement Program that SCRTD\r\ninitiated recently to evaluate and\r\nelevate the quality and effectiveness\r\nof its bus services in the entire Los\r\nAngeles Metropolitan area. The program\r\nis designed to bring existing\r\nSCRTD service into conformance with\r\nexisting and emerging travel patterns,\r\nCertain areas in the Los Angeles\r\nBasin have experienced intense development\r\nand population growth that has\r\nproduced radical changes in the travel\r\nbehavior in those areas. The divergence\r\nbetween transit services and\r\nmobility requirements in local areas\r\nhave become more pronounced since the\r\nelimination of fare zones.\r\nThis report summarizes the work\r\nthat was undertaken to evaluate the\r\ntransit services in one such area -\r\nMid-Cities - and to develop an operational\r\nplan for improving such service.\r\nThe desired plan had to be\r\nsufficiently detailed to be implemented\r\nwithout further analysis.\r\nG~UGRAPHy AND P~OPL~ U~ THE\r\nMIS-CITIES AREA...\r\nThe Mid-Cities area covers 105\r\nsquare miles of southeast Los Angeles\r\nCounty and houses a population of\r\nover 625,000. The population has\r\ngrown from 520,000 to 588,000 between\r\n1960 and 1970, an increase of 13 percent.\r\nBetween 1970 and 1974, it is\r\nestimated that the area\'s population\r\nhas increased by 6.5 percent. In\r\ncontrast, the population of the Los\r\nAngeles Basin has declined by 2 percent\r\nover the same period.\r\nThe topography of much of the\r\nstudy area is flat, the only exceptions\r\nbeing the Puente Hills area in\r\n6Jhittier, and the Los Coyotes Hills\r\nin La Mirada. The relative absence\r\nof other topographic obstacles (the\r\nLos Angeles and San Gabriel Rivers\r\n~o not present a major obstacle to\r\n~~ravel) has helped to produce a network\r\nof arterial streets that have\r\nfacilitated movement within the area.\r\nNorth of Imperial Highway the inclination\r\nof the road grid is alang\r\na southeast-northwest axis. This\r\npattern is determined by the hills to\r\nthe northeast and by the railroad\r\nright-of-way. Major roads that fo~~\r\nlow this inclination are, from nar~~h\r\nto south: Whittier Boulevard, Washington\r\nBoulevard; Telegraph Road,\r\nFirestone Boulevard, and the Santa\r\nAna Freeway.\r\nFrom Imperial Highway South,\r\nthe area exhibits a more or less conventional\r\nsquare grid pattern ali~~ed\r\nalong a north-south axis. Major\r\neast-west arterials south of Imperial\r\nare: Rosecrans Avenue, Alondra B~ulevard,\r\nArtesia Boulevard, South Street,\r\nDel Amo Boulevard, and Carson Street.\r\nANGELES\r\nD THE\r\n;ITIES AREA\r\n2\r\nThere are several major arteries\r\nthat traverse the entire study area\r\nin the north-south direction. Where\r\nthe two grid patterns meet, the orientation\r\nchanges for streets such as\r\nParamount Boulevard, Lakewood-Rosemead\r\nBoulevards, Bellflower Boulevard,\r\nStudebaker Road, Pioneer Boulevard,\r\nNorwalk Boulevard, Carmenita Road and\r\nValley View Avenue.\r\nNew residential construction within\r\nthe last 10 years and the street\r\npattern have contributed to the development\r\nof large shopping plazas and\r\ncommercial corridors. The principal\r\nshopping plazas include the Quad and\r\nWhittwood in Whittier; Stonewood in\r\nDowney; La Mirada Center in La Mirada;\r\nNorwalk Square in Norwalk; Los Cerritos\r\nCenter in Cerritos; and Lakewood\r\nCenter in Lakewood. These centers\r\nprovide not only shopping for area\r\nresidents, but employment as well.\r\nThe population of the Mid-Cities\r\narea is predominantly middle class.\r\nThe average annual household incomes\r\nare distributed over a relatively narrow\r\nrange with 80 percent of -the area\'s\r\npopulation having incomes between\r\n$10,000 and $15,000 per year. Within\r\nthis range, the various income groups\r\nare distributed throughout the area,\r\nalthough the western half tends toward\r\nthe lower end of the income\r\nrange while those in the eastern sections\r\nof the area, i.e. La Mirada and\r\neastern ~~h~ttier, are more affluent.)\r\nThe poor, the elderly and the\r\nyoung that traditionally represent\r\nthe transit dependent group are a\r\nsmall minority of the Mid-Cities area\r\npopulation. With few exceptions, the\r\nelderly represent less than 10 percent\r\nof the population in most Mid-\r\nCities\' census tracts. There are\r\n1/ Based on 1970 U.S. Census\r\n3\r\nconcentrations of elderly in Downey,\r\nWhittier, Santa Fe Springs and Bellf7ower\r\nbut these are generally below\r\n20 percent of the population in\r\nthose census tracts. The population\r\nbelow the poverty level is generally\r\nbelow 7 percent of the total population.\r\nOnly a few pockets of poverty\r\nexist in a few of the census tracts\r\nin Artesia, Paramount/Downey, Pico\r\nRivera, Hawaiian Gardens and Norwalk.\r\nUnlike many areas of Southern\r\nCalifornia where the low income population\r\nis largely of Spanish descent\r\nand is concentrated in a geographic\r\narea, the Spanish speaking population\r\nin the Mid-Cities area is generally\r\nsmall and widely dispersed throughout\r\nthe area. The only important exceptions\r\nare Pico Rivera and a section\r\nof Santa Fe Springs.\r\nIn most suburban areas, transit\r\nusage varies inversely with auto ownership.\r\nAuto ownership for the Mid-\r\nCities study area is high, being\r\nabove 1.6 autos per household. Where\r\nauto ownership is low, it correlates\r\nwith low income. There is very little\r\ncorrelation between transit use\r\nfor work trips and auto ownership.\r\nWhere transit usage is above average\r\nfor the area, auto availability tends\r\nto be low. However, there are a sufficient\r\nnumber of exceptions, e.g.\r\ncensus tracts in La Mirada and Bellflower,\r\nto discourage a convenient\r\ngeneralization.\r\nThe uniformity of income and\r\ntheir distribution ti~roughout the\r\narea accounts, to some extent, for\r\nthe diffusion of travel patterns in\r\nthe-area. The Los Angeles CBD is a\r\nwork trip ,destination for only 1 to\r\n7 percent of all work trips.

II ~..•it.e~le.\r\nRTD operates 16 lines that traverse\r\nthe area. From the point of\r\nview of the current users of the RTD\r\ntransit services, the system offers\r\nimpracticably long travel times, and\r\ninfrequent service. By way of illustration,\r\ntravel times between the\r\ncity halls of the 12 cities exceeds\r\n60 minutes in 76 percent of the\r\ncases. In 24 percent, the travel is\r\nover two hours in duration, reducing\r\nthe effective speed to that of walking.\r\nInfrequent service, measured by\r\nthe headways between buses, is, to a\r\nlarge extent, responsible for the long\r\ntrip times. Even during the peak\r\nmorning and evening hours, headways of\r\n60 minutes and over prevail on half or\r\nmore of the RTD lines operating in the\r\nstudy area. Three of the lines operate\r\nat either 2 or 4 hour headways\r\nduring the peak hours.\r\nFor the same reasons, those in\r\nthe community who would otherwise use\r\npublic transit are turned from it by\r\nthe prevailing service levels. Potential\r\nusers face not only excessive\r\ntravel times, but they are unable to\r\nreach certain, much frequented, destinations.\r\nCerritos College cannot\r\nbe reached by Long Beach residents\r\ntraveling on LBPTC bus lines directly,\r\neven though a significant number of\r\nthem use it.\r\nInterconnections between LBPTC\r\nand SCRTD lines are often absent where\r\nthey are most needed. In several\r\ncases, the lines from the two companies\r\ncome within a few blocks of\r\neach other, discouraging transfers between\r\nlines. On several routes the\r\ntwo companies compete, providing\r\nsuperfluous service and depriving the\r\ncommunity of service in areas where\r\nit is needed.\r\nThe productivity of the service\r\nthat SCRTD provides in the Mid-Cities\r\narea is far below the average for the\r\nrest of its system. The lines that\r\nserve the Mid-Cities area operate at\r\nonly 1.04 passengers per bus mile\r\ncompared to an average of 3.40 passengers\r\nper bus mile for the system.\r\nThe average load factor on SCRTD\r\nbuses in the Mid-Cities area is well\r\nbelow 0.5.\r\nThere are other parameters that\r\nmeasure efficiency with which resources\r\n(labor, vehicles) are applied in revenue\r\nservice. One such measure, the\r\nratio of layover time to operating\r\nhours, is indicative of scheduling\r\nand routing efficiency. The current\r\nsystem averages 23 percent of the operating\r\nhours in layovers, with 5\r\nlines averaging over 30 percent. Operating\r\nspeed is another measure of\r\nefficiency for the operator. For a\r\ngiven level of demand, the higher the\r\noperating speed, the higher the efficiency\r\nwith which vehicles and\r\ndrivers are used in revenue service.\r\nThe average speed of bus services is\r\n17.0 miles per hour,which is above\r\naverage.\r\nR~QUTR~~ TRANSIT IMPROV~M~NTS...\r\nThe existing deficiencies crystallize\r\ninto the following requirements\r\nfor improv9ng service:\r\n~\"r`\'` 1.

The\r\nlines are routed to facilitate movements\r\nbetween principal activity centers\r\nwithin the Mid-Cities area and\r\nto provide direct and frequent service\r\nfrom selected points in the Mid-\r\nCities area to known principal destinations\r\nin other parts of the region.\r\nThe structure of the recommended\r\nsystem consists of six lines: C-1,\r\nC-4, C-6, C-9, C-ll and C-14, that\r\nform the skeleton of the new routes.\r\nAn additional. ten lines serve as tributaries\r\nto the six skeletal lines.\r\nThe skeletal lines are routed largely\r\nalong principal thoroughfares in the\r\narea in order to interconnect principal\r\ndestinations in the Mid-Cities\r\narea and to facilitate interregional\r\ntravel. The spine of the skeletal\r\nnetwork is the C-1 line which would\r\noperate along the Santa Ana Freeway.\r\nThis freeway is the principal highspeed\r\narterial to the Los Angeles CBD\r\nand to such major activity centers in\r\nOrange County as Disneyland, Knotts\r\nBerry Farm, and major employment centers.\r\nSince it virtually bisects the\r\nMid-Cities area diagonally, it is\r\neasily accessible from all parts of\r\nthe area.\r\nThe C-1 line is designed to receive\r\npassengers collected by other\r\nlines from all parts of the Mid-Cities\r\narea and it would serve to bring\r\npeople from other parts of the region\r\ninto the Mid-Cities area. The C-1\r\nline would operate on the freeway,\r\nleaving it at selected interchanges\r\nwithin the Mid-Cities area to discharge\r\nor acquire passengers from\r\nother lines.\r\n—1 ~C-9\r\n.,~o,~,\r\n~~~~ y\r\nOD— COMMERC\r\n..\r\n~ \'+,S I I I I I ~~I I~I I~ It Ii Ii II Iii il Il lI lI l 9iDA HEIGHTS~2 ~ I\r\n/ ~ ~`I,+~~I~,I,~I~~~~I~I f\r\n\\per\r\ni ~I~I~I ~I ~ I I v\r\nLIB ;~f~r~~\r\nI ~\r\n_, z ` i~i~~l ~~ ~~~I~I~I~WJ}II~I~~I~~il~lil~i~l~ r\r\n~ i ~ iR` ERA\' oe HIL 5T. ~\' ~ i ~ i ~ i ,~~\r\nASE wBELLGA ~ ~°~ ,° v ~~ ~ PROPOSE\r\ncuoANVO ~ i A~ m ~ J ~ ,~i ~ ~ f\r\n~q~ RO F,~S a°\' Qo ~ ~~~\r\n~ ~ \'~Yf ~ TF \'\'\" ~ C\'6\r\n\"\' AVEm F~\r\n~\' ~ I ~~ \' ~ A~\'H ~r P I ~ lA M~BRt\r\n7 I ~ ~ I\r\n~` I~I~I~I~ ~\'~\r\no\r\n3 0 ~~\' I I~ ~\r\n~ ~~ I ~~I ~~~~ m !Jl HE\r\n~~Ii~~ HWY. \'IN PERIPL ~ m\'\r\n•\r\n` MIR~D~ ~\r\nilk ~I~ I~iiPP i~\r\nN A I I I\r\nOUNT ~ sT i\r\nt, ~ ~\'k.~ 3 ~ F n\r\ni\r\n~IONDRA ~ BLVD.\r\nI I ~\r\nYi\r\nm ART 1 ICI\r\n~ NL\r\n- _\r\nTESTA , --~ ~ ~ ~ rt \' a~ m BUENA PARK F\r\nBE ~ YIER\'- RTE IA I I I I COMMONWEALTH\r\nw \' W\r\n\' Z rw sr w 57 i ~ ~ ORnN~ i ~ ~,\r\nLONG I~\'~~ T m I I\r\n~~ ~~ ~1M~1 °~ /\r\n•°~o ~~ ~~~~ III\r\nI I I ~ I ~ I i m ~ oil Mh \'^ AV E.\r\nI~~II~~I~~~`FI\r\nIAPALMA\r\n,~\" I ~ I I I ~\r\n~\r\n~~.c~ntaltitk~l KNprT•s_\'\r\n.0 ~g ~ I I I~ I ~~ t7~~ AN F3ERR`~ FARM ,(\r\np\'< I I II~I~ ~\r\n\'HEoSH ~i\r\n3 0 ,:\r\n` /~ 3 ,.

The remaining\r\ntributary lines are designed\r\nto connect with the 6 skeletal lines\r\nand in some cases, to facilitate travel\r\nbetween the Mid-Cities area and\r\nthe region.\r\nAn important consideration in\r\ndesigning the routes for the proposed\r\n16 RTD lines was that of taking full\r\nadvantage of the municipal bus operations\r\nthat are already in existence.\r\nThe level of service offered by these\r\nsyster~s would be uneconomical for RTD\r\nto duplicate. Furthermore, duplicating\r\nthe services would be detrimental\r\nto both RTD and the municipal operators\r\nand would not serve the public.\r\nThe 16 proposed RTD lines provide new\r\nand more effective interchanges with\r\nthe existing municipal lines.\r\nIn harmonizing the services of\r\nthe RTD lines and those of the existing\r\nmunicipal lines, the concept paid\r\nparticular attention to the predominant\r\nmovement patterns. In cases\r\nwhere such movements could be best\r\nstreamlined by avoiding a transfer\r\nbetween an RTD and municipal line,\r\nand extending one or another line to\r\nserve a destination, this course was\r\nfollowed.\r\nThe routing of the 16 proposed\r\nRTD lines and the level of service\r\nproposed for them was also governed\r\nby the desire to offer frequent transfer\r\nopportunities while minimizing\r\nthe delays that attend them. The\r\nresultant transit network forms,a\r\nsystematic grid that offers the user\r\nfairly uniform travel times for equal\r\ndistances regardless of origin, destination,\r\nor travel direction.\r\nIn arriving at levels of service,\r\nthe availability of resources, e.g.\r\nbuses, drivers, and support facilities,\r\nhad to be considered. Accordingly,\r\nthree service level alternatives were\r\nconceived. The Base Level Service operates\r\nbuses at headways that result\r\nin approximately the same number of\r\nbuses and drivers being required as\r\nnow serve the Mid-Cities area. What\r\nis considered a Base Level Service\r\nheadway for one line can, of coarse,\r\ndiffer from that of another line.\r\nThe headways of a line during the\r\npeak, base, and night hours are\r\ngoverned by either demand for service\r\nor, when demand is very light, by a\r\npolicy decision. Since demand for\r\nthe foreseeable future is going to\r\nremain light, the maximum policy\r\nheadway was chosen as 60 minutes.\r\nCertain lines, because of actual or\r\npotential patronage, or because of the\r\ntypes of people and destinations that\r\nthey serve, require more frequent\r\nheadways.\r\nThe next higher proposed service\r\nlevel is Developmental Level A. This\r\nlevel decreases the headways on the\r\nentire system to 30 minutes throughout\r\nthe day, and provides for at least 60\r\nminute headways throughout evening operation\r\non most routes. Service\r\nDeveZopmentaZ.LeveZ B is an extension\r\nof the service offered at Developmental\r\nLevel A, adding to the latter a~-\r\nTRANSFER POSSIBIIiTIES\r\nPROPOSED RTD SYSTEM\r\nINE C-1 42 C-1 C-1 GS C-6 C-7 C-A C•9 C•:0 C-11 C-It .\"-17 Lti C-IS C-IF\r\nC-1 a a a a r a :\r\n-~ .\r\nC-3 • x s\r\n~.~ .\r\n~~S ~ .\r\n~.~\r\n-~\r\n46 z r z r s : a a a\r\nC-9 t x • r s r - r a i a x\r\nC-IA a ~ a : a s e\r\n-~~ _\r\n~-12 .\r\nc-n\r\no-u , : :\r\n~-~5 . . , . . . . ~.\r\nC46 ~ s a a • a a ~ s z\r\n10\r\n~ j .~ ~ Via .. _ ~:. ~ , _ , ~. - ~ ~ r i -.

These are routed so as to\r\napproach a uniform level of accessibility\r\nto bus service in the more\r\ndensely popu]ated sections of the\r\nMid-Cities area.\r\nThe routes that comprise Developmental\r\nLevel B have not been specified\r\nto the level of detail as\r\nthose of the two other service\r\nlevels. The additional routes are\r\nB-1, Downtown Whittier to Cerritos\r\nCenter; B-2, Lakewood Center to\r\nStonewood Center; 6-3, South Los\r\nAngeles to Rio Hondo College; B-4,\r\nSouth Gate to Whittwood Shopping\r\nCenter.\r\nAn important consideration in\r\ndesigning service in the Mid-Cities\r\narea was simplicity of operation and\r\nuse. Headways and routes are kept\r\nas uniform as possible in order to\r\nsimplify the amount of knowledge\r\nthat users and potential users of\r\nthe system would have to have in order\r\nto utilize it. Branching of\r\nlines, for example, has been avoided\r\nbecause they confuse patrons, especially\r\noccassional ones, and because\r\nthey reduce service on each branch.\r\nThe 16 proposed RTD lines would\r\nsupplant the service offered by the\r\nRTD Lines 3$, 46, 54, 58, 72, 111,\r\n112, 113, 116, 117, 118, 132, l36\r\nand 137. Lines 34, 55 and 77 would\r\ncontinue but in an altered form.\r\nLines 34 and 77 would be s~5ght7y\r\nrerouted and would operate on reduced\r\nheadways. Line 55 would terminate\r\nat the Orange County Line.\r\nIts service would be interlined with\r\nthe proposed C-9 line so that headways\r\nand operating costs would be\r\nminimized.\r\nThe recommended system is described\r\nby a map showing the new\r\nSCRTD service into Long Beach, and\r\nthe extensions of the Long Beach\r\nPublic Transportation Company system\r\ninto the Mid-Cities area. The per-\r\n13\r\nTormance or each iine is describes on\r\na Line Summary Form which specifies\r\nrunning time by mileage segment, layover\r\npoints, routing and transfer\r\npoints. The Line Summary Form for\r\nLine C-5 illustrates the format of\r\nthe information. The line parameters\r\nand the level of detail are sufficient\r\nfor scheduling purposes. Service frequencies\r\nare presented for each service\r\nlevel alternative.

Even at\r\nthe Base Service Level, no line would\r\noperate at more than 60 minute headways\r\nduring the day and evening. This\r\nis in sharp contrast to existing service\r\nwhere, even during the peak hours,\r\nseveral lines operate at two hour\r\nheadways. Of the new RTD lines, 65\r\npercent would operate at peak hour\r\nheadways of 30 minutes of less. By\r\ncontrast, only 25 percent of the\r\nexisting RTD lines operate at peak\r\nhour headways of 30 minutes or less.\r\nImprovements in base hour headways\r\nwould be even more impressive. Among\r\nthe current RTD lines, 31 percent operate\r\nbase hour headways above 60\r\nminutes, compared to none for the\r\nproposed system.\r\nThe number of cities that a passenger\r\nin a given city could reach\r\nwould, at least, double for more than\r\n80 percent of the Mid-Cities passengers.\r\nUsing the earlier illustration\r\nof travel time between city halls,\r\nthe new system would offer RTD patrons\r\nan average travel time reduction of 28\r\npercent at the Base Level Service.\r\nThis average masks the more important\r\ntravel time reductions of over 50 percent\r\nfor those destinations where current\r\ntravel times approach or exceed\r\nZ IlOUY\'S .\r\nAt the Base Level Service, 12\r\nof the 66 origin-destination pairs\r\nwould have trip times above those\r\npossible with the current RTD system.\r\nBy operating Lines C-2, C-4, C-9 and\r\nC-16 at Developmental Level A, these\r\ndeficiencies would not only be eliminated\r\nby the trip times of these 12\r\norigin-destination pairs, but would\r\nbe reduced. Although the proposed\r\nrouting does remove service from\r\nsome patrons, the number is small.\r\nBased on work trips that are currently\r\nmade by transit, it is expected that\r\nless than two percent of the trips\r\nwould be displaced.\r\nHEADWAY &SERVICE HOURS OF PROPOSED SYSTEM\r\nPFOPOSED ROLES SERVICE ICE ^t?:~;1v; Ire !•It~;U\':S\r\nP;.C.:1. - R,\'~SE LEl\'[L HOURS Aft Pea: base 4\'N Feak E;~ninq\r\nC 1 Santa llna Freeway 5A- 2A 15 30 15 60\r\nC 2 Artasia Gculevard 54- 7P 60 f0 FO -\r\nC 3 Slauso~i-Garfield SA- lA 3?

Service\r\noperated by the local public tralsit syste;ns of Norwalk, La 6lirada an3 Santa Fe Springs\r\nis not in_luded.\r\nThe increased bus miles offered\r\nby the proposed RTD system and the\r\nimprovements in route distribution\r\nwould increase both the amount of\r\narea and the population covered by\r\ntransit service. It is reasonable\r\nto assume that such increased coverage\r\nwould stimulate eventual increases\r\nin patronage. Using bus\r\nmiles per 1000 population as a measure\r\nof the population being covered,\r\nthe proposed system would increase\r\nthe coverage by an average of 57 percent.\r\nAlthough the population coverage\r\nfalls far below the desired 50\r\nbus miles per 1000 population, the\r\nimprovement for those 12 cities that\r\nare now among the most poorly covered\r\nis several hundred percent. The proposed service offers improved\r\naccess to the most rrequented\r\nshopping plazas. Each of the six\r\nmajor shopping plazas would be served\r\nby no less than 3 transit lines compared\r\nto one or two lines operating\r\nat infrequent headways. One way of\r\nillustrating the improvements in mobility\r\nand accessibility offered by\r\nthe proposed system is a comparison\r\nof the number of places that can be\r\nreached within a 60 minute travel\r\ntime by the current and proposed\r\nsystems.\r\nUsing as an example the travel\r\nbetween city halls of the 12 cities,\r\nthe accompanying charts show that in\r\nmost instances, a resident of a city\r\nwould be able to reach more cities\r\nwithin 60 minutes via the proposed\r\nsystem than is currently the case.\r\nFor example, from Hawaiian Gardens,\r\n6 other cities could be reached within\r\n60 minutes compared to 2 cities\r\nwith the current system. In those\r\ncases where the number of cities that\r\nare accessible remained the same, the\r\nidentity of the city changed. For\r\nexample, the proposed system provides\r\nresidents of La Mirada access to\r\nWhittier in a 60 minute period, replacing\r\nthe less needed access to\r\nArtesia.\r\n16\r\nCITIES* ACCESSIBLE BY PUBLIC TRANSIT FROM A GIVEN CITY\' WITHIN A 60 MINUTE TRAVEL TIME\r\n~,~„ ~ ~~ sire>n\r\nt.~. rn. ~\r\n/ H ~\'i\'_\r\n+S~riTn fE\r\nmnrzr ~ ~.a. tn.\r\nE..._\r\nl~ \"I RM1:\'a \" AFCIfLOfl\'[P\'\r\nvnv,rri~ir ~\r\n~~~,~II J~D~IEIS\r\n/rice /``~\r\nPf YES*\r\nH~~~\r\n3 $nIl\'n FE\r\n* \' * ~nDI4G5 \'.\r\npN%iET 1.~.

Operating at Base Level\r\nService, only 9 additional vehicles\r\nwould be needed. This represents a\r\n10 percent increase in the current\r\nfleet. Daily bus miles would increase\r\nby only 2603. This represents\r\nan increase of 16 percent in\r\nthe total number of bus miles for\r\nall lines (terminus-terminus).\r\nAssuming no increase in the work\r\npassengers that travel the existing\r\nRTD system that. serves the Mid-Cities\r\narea, productivity would decrease by\r\nthat amount. Since the current patronage\r\nis disproportionately low\r\ncompared to what RTD experience\"s\r\nelsewhere, it is reasonable to expect\r\nthat patronage would increase.\r\n19\r\nTha nrnnnca~ cvctrxn nrnmicat\r\nsome increase in operating efficiency.\r\nOne such measure, the ratio of layover\r\ntime to operating time, would be reduced\r\nby an average of 5.4 percent.\r\nA further improvement in headways,\r\ntravel times and population\r\ncoverage can be attained by operating\r\nlines C-1 and C-6 at ~Jevelopmental\r\nLevel A and restoring RTD line 55 in\r\na revised form. This would increase\r\nthe Mid-Cities bus fleet by another\r\n8 buses and the daily hus miles by an\r\nadditional 900.\r\nFinally, the proposed Base Level\r\nService could be expanded so that\r\nlines C-2, C-4, C-9, C-11 and C-16\r\nare also operated at Developmental\r\nLevel A and lines B-3 and B-4 are implemented.\r\nThis expansion would require\r\nan additional 25 buses and 4807\r\nbus miles.\r\nCOMPARISON OF EXISTING &PROPOSED RTD SYSTEMS\r\nOPERnTING OPCRIITING S OF Y OF\r\nPRESEN?

With progressive engineering\r\nover a two-year period, the fuel consumption of steam buses could be improved\r\nuntil it is only 52 percent more than present diesel in stop-and-go\r\nservice. lmprovements in the transmission and powerplant would be required\r\nto achieve this reduction. Eventually, fuel consumption could be improved\r\nuntil it is only 6 percent more than present diesels.\r\nPotential for emissions improvement. Emissions of steam buses could be\r\nreduced significantly by developing cleaner burners and by consuming less\r\nfuel. Within two years, present steam bus emissions of CO could be reduced\r\nby 68 percent and HC plus by 67 percent. Eventually, steam bus\r\nemissions of CO could be reduced by 88 percent of present levels and HC\r\nplus by 89 percent.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe California Steam Bus Project successfully achieved its goals. Both the\r\nmission and the organization may appear unorthodox, but the involvement\r\nof many concerned private and public entities at an early date was very beneficial.\r\nSteam propulsion systems were the first alternate power systems to be\r\nvisibly supported by the public sector. Continued research and development\r\nis essential, if not for steam alone, then to legitimize other possible alternatives.\r\nThis is the only way to insure that the sources of vehicular air pollution\r\ncan be corrected, if attempts to control existing power systems fail. Acceleration\r\nof low-emission engine development appears to be among the more\r\npressing needs in society. Public agencies have responsibilities to support both\r\nthe and the market. Buses are, in a sense, merely symbolic of the\r\nvariety of vehicles that could benefit from needed powerplant improvements.\r\nRECOMMENDATIONS\r\ncycle engines were found to have attributes that are needed in\r\nurban transportation. With further development, present drawbacks, such as\r\nhigh fuel consumption, can be eliminated or considerably reduced. Advantages,\r\nsuch as engine braking, can be developed in the future. The Assembly\r\nOffice of Research, therefore, recommends the following:\r\n1. We recommend the continued exploration of the cycle by\r\ndeveloping an application for heavy duty vehicles in a basic research and development\r\nprogram.\r\n2. We caution that many years of progressive and persistent engineering\r\nwill be needed to make cycle powerplants technically feasible. Such\r\na program should consist of the following elements:\r\n(1) A frontal attack on technical problems identified by the\r\nSteam Bus Project and other programs.\r\n(2) Stress on design engineering and bench testing, rather than\r\nand demonstrations.\r\n(3) Exploration of both turbine and reciprocating expanders, because\r\nit is not yet clear which form is superior for heavy-duty, stop-and-go vehicles.\r\n(4) Use of the research work on cycle components and systems\r\ncurrently sponsored by the Environmental Protection Agency for automotive\r\napplication.\r\nFunding at no less than $20 million over a four-year period.\r\n3. i t development phase clearly indicates the potential of this\r\nalternate we recommend that the federal government make the policy\r\ndecisions that will be required to achieve the reality of low emission vehicles\r\nfor urban areas, including automobiles, and buses.\r\n4. We encourage all state legislatures to follow California\'s lead by considering\r\nthe need for market support if a suitable alternate propulsion system\r\nis developed. Such a need could be addressed by the following threefold legislative\r\nprogram:\r\n(1) Establish low emission vehicle certification programs that rank\r\npropulsion systems by their cleanliness and performance.\r\n(2) As a matter of public policy provide incentives, such as subsidies\r\nor tax relief to heavy duty vehicle users for purchasing low emission fleet\r\nvehicles, especially because such vehicles may be available only at premium\r\nprices.\r\n(3) Legislate more stringent heavy duty vehicle emission standards\r\nfor urban areas when clean alternatives are available, after fleet operational\r\nfeasibility is demonstrated and low emission experience is validated.\r\nPROJECT HISTORY\r\nThe California State Assembly submitted a grant application to the Urban\r\nMass Transportation Administration (UMTA) of the U.S. Department of\r\nTransportation on December 17, 1968, seeking funds to demonstrate and\r\ntest ECE systems in city buses. This application was approved on February 17,\r\n1969, making this the first major research grant made to a state legislative\r\nbody.\r\nQualified suppliers of ECE systems were sought by means of a Request\r\nfor Proposals issued on May 1969. Replies from potential suppliers revealed\r\nthat ECE systems, far from being available off-the-shelf, would require\r\nextensive engineering development before any demonstration could be\r\nscheduled. With this knowledge, the program was restructured to provide\r\ntime and funds for development and new proposals were solicited.\r\nOn September 20, 1969, a panel of eight experts appointed by the\r\nsystem\r\nsteam\r\n&\r\n(AC\r\nOakIand.\r\nDiego,\r\nmie\r\nfirm\r\n&\r\n(IR&T), which\r\nbecame IR&T. represeuted\r\nmodel\r\nfurrlished\r\nSan\r\nCominittee\r\ntlighways.\r\nWillianl &\r\na~?d steal11\r\nto\r\nStearn\r\nand\r\nexperiinental den~onstrations.\r\ndeinonstrated\r\nNoveinber Steam\r\nby\r\nmodern\r\nnumber\r\nsome\r\nfluid. continuous-\r\n\"normartrany\r\nconlpromises\r\ncommercially\r\ntransmissions\r\n~ e v e l o ~ m \' e n t\r\nbly selected the three best qualified vendors.\r\nThe actual work of designing and developing these\r\npower systems\r\nbegan with the signing of engineering contracts in June, 1970. Each system\r\nvendor was paired with a transit district as follows:\r\n1. William M. Brobeck Associates, Berkeley, California with neighboring\r\nAlameda-Contra Costa Transit District Transit) headquartered in\r\n2. Lear Motors Corporation, Reno, Nevada with the San Francisco Municipal\r\nRailway (S.F. Muni).\r\n3. Steam Power Systems (SPS), San California, with nearby Southern\r\nCalifornia Rapid Transit District (SCRTD) in Los Angeles.\r\nOverall direction was provided by the Assembly Office of Research. This\r\noffice was assisted by two systems management firms. first was Scientific\r\nAnalysis Corporation (SAC), a non-profit research in San Francisco,\r\nwhich was to administer the project on a daily basis, conduct public and\r\npatron attitude surveys and supervise making of a documentary motion\r\npicture. The second was International Research Technology Corporation\r\na Washington, D.C. firm, was to monitor and report technical\r\nprogress and evaluate bus performance through a field office in San Ramon,\r\nCalifornia. Kerry Napuk was made project manager by SAC and Roy Renner\r\nproject technical manager for These system managers\r\nthe Assembly on all matters of administration, coordination and evaluation.\r\nAC Transit and SCRTD contributed late coaches to be retrofitted\r\nto steam power. Lear Motors its own bus and powerplant for lease\r\nto S.F. Muni. The Bay Area Educational Television Association, KQED, in\r\nFrancisco, was selected to film project activities. Exhaust emissions were\r\ntested and evaluated by the California Air Resources Board. The California\r\nHighway Patrol measured sound levels and performed motor carrier safety\r\ninspections. Support also was provided by the Assembly Rules\r\nstaff, the Auditor General\'s Office, Division of Department of Public\r\nHealth and the Office of Insurance. During special demonstrations, assistance\r\nwas provided by D.C. Transit and the Sacramento Transit Authority.\r\nBrobeck Associates was the first to complete installation work\r\nhave a bus operational, in September, 1971. This bus was delivered\r\nAC Transit on September 27, 197 1. The Lear installation was first operated\r\nin January, 1972 and delivered to San Francisco on July 20, 1972.\r\nPower Systems completed installation in March, 1972 brought the bus\r\nto Los Angeles on August 7, 1972.\r\nIn addition to participating in engineering testing and fleet trials, these\r\nvehicles were involved in two major\r\nThe Brobeck-AC Transit steam bus was in Washington, D.C.\r\non 17, 1971, in conjunction with a Bus Symposium sponsored\r\nUMTA and the U.S. Department of Transportation. During its stay\r\nin the nation\'s capitol, the first steam bus traveled more than 75\r\nmiles and carried nearly 500 people in showings to Department of Transportation\r\nofficials, members of Congress and symposium guests.\r\nOn April 26, 1972, all three steam buses were demonstrated before members\r\nof the California Legislature in Sacramento.\r\nFinancially, the original grant application requested $450,000. This figure\r\nproved to be inadequate and California made application for added funds\r\nwhich were subsequently approved. At the end of the program, federal funds\r\ntotaled $2,294,525. Local contributions of about $5.7 million were made to\r\nthe project by the state, the transit districts, and by the system contractors.\r\nThus, the total project cost was approximately $8 million. The largest share\r\nwas the local contribution made by the system contractors, approximately\r\n$5.5 million.\r\nTECHNICAL EXPERIENCE\r\nIntroduction\r\nDuring the experimental period, the three contractors were encouraged to\r\ndevelop their own design approaches. Each vendor considered or implemented\r\nmore than one design which benefited the project. Reciprocating, rotary and\r\nturbine engines reached preliminary bench test stages. A of working\r\nfluids other than water were examined. Several variations of control systems,\r\nauxiliary drives, feed pumps and burners went onto an expensive junk pile\r\nbefore vehicles became operational.\r\nThe final systems had features in common. All used water as the\r\nworking All vendors generated steam in forced-circulation,\r\ncoil tubular steam generators. Steam temperature control was by the\r\nlizer\" principle in which supplemental water is injected into the superheater\r\nas required. Condensing was by fan-cooled, tinned tubular radiators. While a\r\nvariety of liquid fuels may be used. No. 1 diesel was selected because it was\r\nthe standard fuel of the industry.\r\nBecause time was an important factor, technical had to\r\nbe accepted. As an expedient, available multi-ratio automatic\r\ntorque converter were used, even though these converters were\r\nnot well matched to steam expanders. Fixed cut-off was used in the piston\r\nengines instead of the more difficult but much more efficient variable cut-off\r\ntypes. The main expanders were used to drive accessories at idle, although\r\nmore efficient methods were known. of engine retarding with a\r\npiston engine, although desirable. was bypassed in this program. Complete\r\noperational safety, on the other hand, was a mandatory requirement, which\r\nall vendors met satisfactorily.\r\nWilliarr~ &\r\nmonotube stearn\r\nmounted\r\nelements the\r\n1.\r\ninodel\r\n28 m.p.h.\r\ndiarneter\r\nexpan-\r\n<ion low-preswre\r\n1\r\nmajor\r\naccomodate\r\nsteam\r\nI970\r\nburners\r\nwlth tlie\r\n5.6 r.p.rn.\r\n1\r\nautomatic transn~ission\r\npuinp.\r\nburner\r\ntlie\r\nSPS\r\nThree\r\nSCRTD\'s\r\norignal angleovercar\'eful\r\nSystem descriptions\r\nM. Brobeck Associates. The Brobeck system was an outgrowth\r\nof the automatic generators and compound-expansion piston\r\nengines developed earlier by Doble and Besler. The steam generator and its\r\nautomatic controls were in the engine compartment at the rear,\r\nwhile other system were located amidships under floor as shown\r\nin Figure All accessory and auxiliary units were belt driven from pulleys on\r\nthe forward end of the engine carnkshaft. Condenser fans were remotely\r\ndriven by hydraulic motors. The transmission was a Dana-Spicer 184\r\nwith two speed torque converter unit, which locked up into direct drive at\r\nBrobeck\'s steam generator was of the continuous-coil, forced-circulation\r\ntype, using about one quarter mile of small tubing which is shown\r\ninstalled in Figure 2. Both tangential and axial burner firings were explored,\r\nwith the former yielding better results in this configuration. The burner used\r\na single air-atomizing nozzle, with automatic switching among four steady\r\nstate levels: off, idle, low fire and high fire.\r\nBrobeck\'s expander had three double acting cylinders. Compound\r\nwas used, with one high pressure cylinder exhausting into two\r\ncylinders. As an expedient, a non-reversible fixed cut-off valve gear was\r\nused. By placing the system components in existing spaces, the original seating\r\ncapacity for 5 passengers was retained. AC Transit\'s coach was a 1969\r\nGeneral Motors bus, which, like all other vehicles in this program, was 40 feet\r\nlong and 102 inches wide, weighing between 2 1,000 and 22,000 pounds unladen.\r\nLear Motors Corporation. The Lear system differed strikingly from the\r\nother two in its use of a turbine as an expander. All components are\r\nplaced in the engine compartment, which had to be enlarged to\r\nthe generator configuration and regenerators and, thereby, reduced the\r\noriginal seating capacity by five passengers. Lear Motors supplied their own\r\nGeneral Motors bus.\r\nLear Motors\' steam generator featured a radial outflow of hot cornbustion\r\ngases through the tube bundle. During development. several types of\r\nwere tried. including vaporizing, mechanical atomizing and air atomizing,\r\nlatter finally adopted.\r\nThis vehicle appears to be the first in history to be successfully propelled\r\nby a steam turbine. The single stage impulse turbine was small, with a wheel\r\ndiameter of inches, and rotated at high speed, up to 65,000 Reduction\r\ngearing of 34 to connected the turbine through an Allison HT-740\r\nfour-speed to the rear axle. Most auxiliaries also were\r\ndriven fro111 the speed reducing gearbox, including the feed water two\r\ncondenser fans and blower. Figures 3 and 4 show the general arrangement\r\nof this powerplant and its installation in demonstration bus.\r\nSteam Power Systems, Inc. The powerplant featured a six-cylinder,\r\ndouble-acting compound-expansion engine. Steam was reheated between the\r\ntwo expansion stages. Steam generation was by a series-parallel tubular boiler,\r\nwith an additional section for the inter-stage re-superheating. The steam generator,\r\nexpander, auxiliaries and one condenser were located in the rear engine\r\ncompartment, which was enlarged at the sacrifice of five rear seats for\r\npassengers. additional condensers were located under the bus, just\r\nbehind the front axle. Installed components in 1968 Flexible bus\r\nare shown in Figures 5 and 6.\r\nOf the three buses, the SPS bus was the only one to provide air conditioning\r\nand retain the transmission, a GM-Allison Super V, and\r\ndrive rear axle. Two significant innovations were carried to bench test, but\r\nwere laid aside when time did not permit development. One attempted innovation\r\nwas the use of infinitely variable cut-off valve gear, which would allow\r\nengine speed control without a throttling valve while being conducive to high\r\nthermal efficiency. Another attempt was the elimination of oil lubricants in\r\nthe steam cylinder, which would avoid the problem of oil carryover into the\r\ncondenser and boiler.\r\nSafety. Complete operational safety was a firm requirement with surveillance\r\nand control exercised during all phases, such as design review, laboratory\r\nproof-testing and frequent in-service inspections. The following criteria were\r\napplied:\r\n1. Toxic, flammable or explosive working fluids were not permitted.\r\n2. Steam generators were designed to be inherently nonexplosive.\r\n3. Several safety limiting devices were used, such as pressure and temperature\r\nlimit switches in the automatic steam generator control circuits, as\r\nwell as safety valves.\r\n4. Limiting governors were applied to prevent accidental expander\r\nspeeding.\r\n5. Flame sensors were installed to stop fuel flow in the event of ignition\r\nfailure.\r\n6. Driver controls were simplified and made as similar as possible to those\r\nfor a standard diesel coach.\r\nIn this project, large pressurized vessels were not permitted for steam\r\ngeneration, which eliminated any possibility of a sudden explosive release of\r\nthe boiler\'s energy content. A relatively small amount of steam and water is\r\nconfined to a long coiled length of tubing as shown in Figure 5. On a number\r\nof occasions, tube failures did occur in these experimental steam generators,\r\nbut they proved to be inconveniences rather than hazards.\r\nBecause of good design practice and workmanship by system\r\nvendors, the potential hazard level of these systems was judged to be similar\r\nto that of gas turbines, which have large quantities of fuel burned in combustors\r\noutside an engine block.\r\nperfor~t~allce. stcain vel~iclcs a]-e equal~ng\r\nto\r\nthe\r\n~nade\r\nsteam\r\n[net the\r\n(bhp/hr)\r\ncorribined bhp/hr.

Several tests were of exhaust emissions of diesel and\r\nbuses by the California Air Resources Board. Results confirm that the\r\nECE can produce low exhaust emissions even though the steam buses consumed\r\nsignificantly more fuel. All steam buses 1975 California heavy\r\nduty vehicle standards, which limit carbon monoxide emissions to 25 grams\r\nper brake horsepower hour and hydrocarbons ancl nitrogen oxides\r\nto 5 grams per diesel buses tested easily met the CO\r\nrequirements, none came close the combined HC and limits.\r\nWhen the cleanest bus was compared to a of the cleanest\r\ndiesel bus test data, the bus produced 30.5 percent less CO and 86.0\r\npercent less and Of special interest was a percent reduction in\r\nrecorded by the cleanest steam bus. Testing was done with a chassis\r\ndynamometer, with emissions during 13 separate steady-state\r\nof speed and load. This procedure does not include any road load transients\r\nduring sampling, but transients boiler and to hold a given road\r\nwere integrated into test results.\r\nAll emissions tests with Number One diesel fuel. proper\r\nadjustment, is virtually smokeless. During testing, smoke opacity\r\nwere similar to of well-maintained diesels, with readings generally\r\nof one to three percent except for occasional visible smoke when loads\r\nwere changed. Light odors reminiscent of gas turbine or jet engine exhaust\r\nwere noted.\r\nNoise. The California Highway Patrol surveys of sound levels both\r\ninside the buses and in near-field outside environment. Three types of\r\ntests were conducted: first, drive-by, full throttle: standing start: and\r\nthird, interior.\r\nTest results are in the of decibel readings, which are\r\nmeasures ofsound-pressure levels. scale is thus, a reduction\r\nof three decibels corresponds to a 50 percent reduction of levels.\r\nDuring drive-by tests, the quietest bus was 2.5 to 10 decibels below\r\nat a of 50 feet. Moreover. the quietest bus in\r\ncurb-side tests was 6 to below the quietest diesels tested. On the\r\nother interior levels were similar or diesels,\r\nthe exception of the latest results for the Brobeck powerplant installation.\r\nThe Lear emitted a frequency sound of turbines.\r\nIt is that and radiated sound levels of\r\nnow than diesels, can be reduced by proven\r\nin gas turbine practice.\r\nFuel Steam buses had very high fuel consumption. The best\r\ncruise of the Brobeck power plant was per (mpg)\r\nat 30 while a diesel bus can achieve 7 to under same\r\nconditions. During actual stop-and-go route conditions. fuel rates of\r\nto 1.1 mpg noted with diesel rates of 3.02 to 3.68 mpg.\r\nalso with steam systems using 3.2 to 4.7\r\ngallons per hour compared with diesel figures of 0.5 to 0.65 gallon per hour.\r\ncharacteristics. Driver controls on steam vehicles were similar\r\nto those on the diesel coach before conversion. These controls a foot\r\nthrottle. air brake treadle and forward-neutral-reverse selector lever. In addition\r\nto the original panel instruments, a tachometer and a steam pressure\r\nwere included along with indicator signifying powerplant conditions\r\nincipient problems.\r\nAll fire-up procedures were controlled from the driver\'s seat. Sufficient\r\nsteam to start the expander was available within a from a cold\r\non. While careful warm-up of the expander required an additional two to five\r\nminutes for systems reciprocators, the Lear turbine could as soon\r\nas steam was ready. All steam systems had to be driven for a few\r\nbefore entire system reached proper and power\r\nwas available. Once the powerplant is hot, however, it be restarted within\r\na of seconds. after a lapse of 30 minutes.\r\nAlthough all three power systems\r\ncondensers for recovery of\r\nwater, none was a completely sealed system. By means of relief valves, excess\r\nexhaust could be relieved under overload on a day. The\r\noriginal goal was a touring range at least equal to a day\'s operation for\r\ndiesel buses. In practice, however, all steam buses fell short of this\r\ngoal. because of unfavorable condenser mounting configurations (Brobeck\r\nand SPS) and periods of insufficient turbine operating speed (Lear).\r\nWaste heat release a cycle powerplant is appreciably greater\r\nthan that of internal combustion engine Much consideration. therefore,\r\nwas given to directing heat flow away from passenger\r\nand bystanders.\r\ncycles. the project. diesel and steam buses were fitted\r\nwith portable instruments for measuring and recording a number of vehicular\r\nand route characteristics. Urban bus routes were then experimentally driven\r\nwith a constant ballast payload of 4.500 pounds. representing a partial load of\r\n30 passengers. Several types of driving cycles encountered by urban and suburban\r\nbuses were and used as a basis for evaluating\r\nHayward, San\r\nHayward\r\nHayward\r\nniiles steam\r\nfuellair\r\nS.F.\r\n14\r\nmaximunl\r\nh\r\nSan\r\n1,\r\nIn\r\nsteam\r\nIts\r\nniiles\r\nI I\r\nDiego\r\n29,operatingon It\r\nforn~ance,\r\n~ u b l i c ,\r\nat,Berkeley\r\n1970\r\nperformance.\r\nPUBLIC SERVICE EXPERIENCE\r\nSteam buses entered revenue passenger service in the cities of Oakland,\r\nBerkeley, Francisco and Los Angeles. The longest individual\r\npublic service was eighteen operating days; the shortest was two. Several\r\nspecial demonstrations were provided, however, before and after delivery of\r\nthe steam buses to their assigned transit districts. These three vehicles accumulated\r\na total of 8,372 road miles, including about 800 miles while carrying\r\npaying passengers.\r\nPublic experience on a district-by-district basis was as follows:\r\nAC Transit. On January 23, 1972, the AC Transit steam bus entered its first\r\nday of public service, operating from East Oakland to Berkeley and back.\r\nWhile completing its third round trip of the day, an engine failure, involving\r\na broken crosshead, forced the vehicle to retire only three blocks from completing\r\nits day\'s service.\r\nOn May 25, 1972, the steam bus returned to public service making one\r\nround trip per day between Oakland and Berkeley. On June 5, the bus operated\r\nfrom downtown to Oakland and back. During eight days of public\r\nservice, 13 one-way trips were completed and three were aborted. Numerous\r\noperating problems were encountered, including control instability, a\r\nblower motor failure, a feed water pump failure, relief valve bellows failure\r\nand poor water consumption. The steam bus was withdrawn from public\r\nservice on June 9 to undergo improvements.\r\nOn September 19, 1972, the AC Transit steam bus returned to public\r\nservice, operating between downtown and downtown Oakland, a\r\ndistance of 39 miles. It operated on this route for nine continuous days without\r\nany operational problem, ending service on September 29, the last day of\r\noperation under the project terminated on September 30. Operating at much\r\nreduced noise levels, coach Number 666 traveled 353 miles during this period,\r\naccumulating a total of 3,465 under power from September 1971\r\nthrough September 1972. No stops were required for water or fuel, and only\r\noccasional odors from an improper ratio marred its otherwise perfect\r\nservice.\r\nMunicipal Railway. On August 7, 1972, the Muni Railway steam turbine\r\nbus began its revenue service between the Southern Pacific Station and\r\nFisherman\'s Wharf and back. On August 9 through 11, it was withdrawn from\r\nservice to make a boiler repair and to adjust the burner which emitted noticeable\r\nsmoke. From August through 18, the coach operated as a commuter\r\nshuttle between the Ferry Building and the S.P. Station, making up to four\r\ntrips a day with a of 98 passengers on board. From August 22\r\nthrough 25, it operated on a more rigorous route involving ten miles of freeway\r\nand a six percent grade. On August 25, during the last day of public\r\nservice, the steam turbine bus attempted two round trips with full loads and\r\nlost a fan belt on the combustion air blower on a freeway during rush traffic.\r\nThis was the only operational problem during eleven days of revenue service,\r\nand the bus returned to the barn under its own power.\r\nOn at least two occasions, once with a simulated payload of 4,500 pounds\r\nand once with fifteen passengers, the bus successfully traversed the Sacramento\r\nStreet route, which includes San Francisco\'s steepest bus grades of l\r\nand 19 percent. Underscoring its relatively trouble-free time in San Francisco.\r\nthe steam bus was driven from Francisco to Reno under its own power on\r\nAugust 31 and September traveling 230 miles over the Sierra Nevada without\r\nmajor problems. During its brief exposure, therefore, the bus provided\r\nearly indications of the potential for high system reliability. eight months\r\nof operation since January, this bus traveled 3,900 miles.\r\nSCRTD. During its first week of public service, the SCRTD bus\r\nencountered numerous difficulties. first two days of attempted public\r\nservice on September 5 and 6 were aborted, because a bolt sheared on the\r\nconibustor air fan assembly and a gear mechanism in the oil pump failed. On\r\nSeptember 7, the bus entered public service, but it completed only a one-way\r\ntrip of 7.3 because a pulley slipped which prevented the fan from turning\r\ninside the boiler. On September 8, the bus was withdrawn from public\r\nservice when a boiler leak was detected; however, the bus traveled 86 miles\r\non September during performance testing until the boiler leak deteriorated.\r\nAfter the bus was towed to San and the repaired boiler was installed,\r\nthe bus returned to Los Angeles on September 28 and re-entered public service\r\non September Wilshire Boulevard. completed a successful\r\n15-mile round trip with air conditioning operational and favorable perexcept\r\nfor a loose battery terminal which caused a 27-minute\r\ndelay. The bus thereby completed its second and last day of public service,\r\nbecause vendor and fleet operator contracts expired on September 30. In 5.5\r\nmonths since March, this bus logged 1,007 road miles.\r\nPUBLIC ATTITUDES\r\nPart of the project evaluation involved measuring public understanding\r\nand acceptance of steam propulsion systems. The attitudes of four groups\r\nwere surveyed: the general diesel and steam bus riders, transit district\r\nmanagers and steam bus drivers.\r\nCommunity attitude surveys. Three surveys conducted by the Survey Research\r\nCenters at the University of California and at Los Angeles\r\nwere designed to measure public concern about air pollution and the need for\r\nalternative transportation systems. Standard nietropolitan surveys were conducted\r\nin Los Angeles County in October and November and in March\r\nIn\r\nHayward,\r\nLos\r\n(63%),\r\n12.5%-\r\nonly\r\nOnly 4%\r\nRankine\r\n16\r\nand April 197 1. The San Francisco Bay Area was tested May and June 197 1.\r\nthe Los Angeles County studies, air pollution ranked as the third most\r\nserious domestic problem facing Americans today (53%). Concern over the\r\nseriousness of air pollution held constant for variables of age, income, education\r\nand ethnic background, except for blacks who placed property taxes,\r\nrace relations and quality of schools ahead of air pollution. Moreover, 85% of\r\nthose sampled felt air pollution had reached a point where it was dangerous to\r\nhuman health.\r\nWhen asked to identify the causes of air pollution, 67% of respondents\r\nblamed the automobile. When asked whether or not steam buses would help\r\nreduce smog, 42% of those surveyed thought steam buses would help a great\r\ndeal and 38% thought they would help some. More than 85% of the respondents\r\nwould ride a bus powered by steam, if they had an opportunity to do so.\r\nAn insignificantly small number (1.3%) expressed fear about riding steam\r\nbuses.\r\nA survey was conducted in the San Francisco Bay Area with similar results.\r\nPatron surveys. Rider reaction of steam buses was measured by surveying\r\n239 passengers on the three steam buses and 307 riders of conventional diesel\r\nbuses traveling the same routes at the same times in Oakland, San\r\nFrancisco and Angeles. Because of carefully controlled selection procedures,\r\nthe diesel and steam bus riders shared similar characteristics, which\r\ninsured a high reliability for comparisons. Interviews were spaced throughout\r\nthe day.\r\nSteam bus riders were asked about their reactions to the experimental\r\nvehicle itself. Overall acceptance was high. Almost 65% said they noticed\r\nsome difference in performance. Most riders felt the bus provided a smoother\r\nride produced less smoke (74%) and generated less air pollution than\r\na diesel (83%). Opinions on odors, noise and vehicular power varied dramatically\r\nwith each steam bus.\r\nOn the important question whether riders felt steam buses would help\r\nreduce air pollution, 47% of the steam bus riders felt it would help a great\r\ndeal, 44% said it would help somewhat and only 1.7% felt it would be of little\r\nhelp. Diesel bus riders saw less impact, with 32% believing it would help a\r\ngreat deal and 44% that it would help somewhat.\r\nTransit manager surveys. Sixty-five transit managers who operated at least\r\n100 buses were mailed questionnaires. The 48 responses represented public\r\nand private ownership of about 86% of all city buses. The relatively large\r\nresponse rate allows the data to be considered both representative and reliable.\r\nNearly all transit managers, both public and private, expressed concern over\r\nair pollution. About 54% felt it was very serious and 40% believed it was\r\nfairly serious. When asked if it had reached a point to be dangerous to health,\r\n42% said that it had and 40% thought it might have.\r\nThe majority of managers (67%) believed the transit industry needed to\r\nadopt a clean propulsion system. If steam buses offered quieter and cleaner\r\noperation, would transit managers purchase them? About 54% said yes,\r\nsaid no and one-third had no opinion. When asked if they thought steam buses\r\nwould help reduce air pollution, however, only 2% said a great deal and 27%\r\nsaid it would help some, but about 54% believed it would be of little help.\r\nIf steam buses were available at a higher price than diesels, how much\r\nwould transit managers pay? were willing to pay one-fourth more and\r\n20% were willing to pay one-tenth more. One-third of the managers were not\r\nwilling to pay any premium. Another two-fifths wanted to wait for more information\r\non operating costs or expressed no opinion.\r\nSteam bus driver attitudes. An in-depth personal interview was conducted\r\nwith five drivers who operated both diesel and steam buses, and who had between\r\nnine and 43 years of service. Three drivers were regular operators and\r\ntwo were instructors.\r\nWhen asked which bus they would choose to operate on a daily basis, all\r\nfive drivers said they would prefer the steam bus, because if provided a\r\nsmoother, quieter ride and was less polluting; however, all drivers recognized\r\nthat many improvements would have to be made in steam buses before a\r\nchoice of vehicles became a reality.\r\nPOTENTIAL FOR IMPROVEMENTS\r\nGeneral outlook. The External Combustion Engine attacks the problem of\r\nair pollution at its roots, which are the physics and chemistry of the combustion\r\nprocess. Almost by definition, the ECE can have the cleanest combustion\r\nsystem possible. With its smooth, quiet application of high torque\r\npropelling energy, the cycle appears to be an excellent candidate for\r\nurban vehicles operating under stop-and-go conditions.\r\nSome years, perhaps less than a decade if funding is adequate, of progressive\r\nengineering work will be required before the ECE is ready for general\r\napplication and acceptance. Obvious areas for improvement are fuel economy,\r\noperating reliability, system layout, combustor technology, automatic controls\r\nand improved transmissions. Winterizing mobile steam powerplants is\r\nanother important consideration.\r\nFuel Consumption. High fuel consumption in the steam buses has been\r\nidentified as the largest obstacle to the potential acceptance of these alternate\r\nsystems. Such concern goes beyond the economics of fleet operations, since\r\nfuel costs are only about three percent of the total costs of operating bus\r\nsystems. An additional consideration is an impending national energy crises.\r\nOther important reasons to improve fuel economy are as follows:\r\n1. The already low total emissions of the ECE would be reduced even\r\nfurther.\r\n2. Waste heat released into the environment would be reduced.\r\n3. Boilers and condensers would become smaller and lighter.\r\n4.\r\nRankine\r\nfroin\r\nattairlahle\r\n70% eventually. gains made\r\nfans,\r\nredu~zd\r\nin\r\nIn\r\nelirn~nation\r\ntime\r\nnipg.\r\nmpg inore\r\ndevelopnlent\r\namount\r\ntirne,\r\nsteadyone-\r\nNOx steam\r\nRankine\r\nmarket\r\nconlmonality\r\nmatter\r\nCondenser fan power requirements also would decrease. increasing\r\nsystem efficiency and reducing noise.\r\nImprovements in fuel consumption can be made in a number of separate\r\nareas as follows:\r\nI . Basic improvements can be made by increasing temperatures of steam\r\nor other working fluids. Values of ideal cycle efficiency can be raised\r\nthe present 25% to about 30% in the short term of two years and to 32\r\nto 35% or more eventually.\r\n2. The present thermal efficiencies are as low as 30%of the ideal cycle\r\nefficiency. Sixty percent of the ideal efficiency may bc in the short\r\nterm and possibly Major can be by reducing\r\nparasitic auxiliary loads and by increasing expansion efficiencies. One example\r\nfor auxiliary load reduction is improvement in condenser which consume\r\n30 horsepower in present systems but could be to 10 or 15\r\nhorsepower with more efficient fans.\r\n3. The present method of sustaining the whole steam powerplant at idle\r\nis wasteful. The use of a small auxiliary expander for essential idle loads could\r\nreduce idle fuel consumption by two-thirds.\r\n3. Heavy power losses incurred with transrnissions used this project,\r\nbecause available units were poorly matched to expander characteristics.\r\nthe case of reciprocating steam engines, direct-drive or, at least,\r\nof the hydraulic torque converter would appreciably increase vehicular efficiency.\r\nTransmission improvements also are possible for turbine expanders,\r\nwhichwould allow the turbine to operate more of the at peak efficiency.\r\nThe above improvements would have a major impact on fuel consumption.\r\nAt present, diesel buses average around 3.5 mpg under local route conditions,\r\nand the best present steam bus about 1 It should be possible, however,\r\nto raise the fuel mileage of steam buses to about 2.3 with two years\r\nof and to 3.3 mpg within a decade\'s time. Eventually, then,\r\nthere would be a differential of only six percent between steam and diesel\r\nvehicles.\r\nEmissions. Although emissions demonstrated in this program were acceptably\r\nlow, they were not optimized. Further reductions can be obtained by\r\ntwo actions: first, reducing the amount of pollutants generated per pound of\r\nfuel burned through cleaner combustion; second, reducing, in turn, the\r\nof fuel burned per horsepower hour of work produced.\r\nBurners produced in this early demonstration were designed and built\r\nwithout the benefit of extensive cornbustion research. Since that a new\r\nbody of pertinent research information became available through contracts\r\nsponsored by the Advanced Automotive Power Systems (AAPS) program of\r\nthe Environmental Protection Agency. One of their contractors, in\r\nstate burner tests, demonstrated, on the basis of grams pollutant per unit\r\nmass of fuel burned, less than one-fourth the CO, one-tenth the HC and\r\nthird the found in some of the better bus emission test runs.\r\nFigure 7 portrays the magnitude of projected future reductions.\r\nSystem layout. Much was learned from these installations, even though\r\nwork was on the basis of performing an ad-hoc retrofit. It was found, for\r\nexample, that the cycle system offers considerable flexibility in the\r\nlocation of major components in the chassis. While the total volume occupied\r\nby the ECE probably always will be greater than space occupied by present\r\ndiesels, it was shown that seating capacity need not be reduced. Both volurne\r\nand weight will diminish with future development. Substantial progress already\r\nwas made in reducing the relative size and weight of system components. The\r\nLear steam generator, for example, can deliver more than twice the power of\r\nearlier Doble units without increased size or weight.\r\nPresent diesel propulsion systems, with transmission and auxiliary items,\r\nweigh about 19 lbs. per net horsepower. The present Lear system weighs\r\napproximately 17 lbs. per net horsepower. Therefore, it is realistic to expect\r\n15 lbs. per net horsepower would be possible in the short term and 10 or 12\r\nlbs. per horsepower eventually.\r\nCost projections. More engineering must be done before initial cost of\r\npowerplants can be accurately forecast. Future steam systems will cost more\r\nper pound than diesels, but they will be considerably lighter in weight. Unit\r\ncosts are sensitive to the production quantities involved. Because the urban bus\r\nrepresents less than 5,000 units per year in the foreseeable future,\r\nwith other segments of the heavy-duty engine market might be\r\nneeded to keep costs at reasonable levels.\r\nMaintenance costs. Eventual maintenance costs also remain a of\r\nspeculation. Costs to service brakes and transmissions may be reduced with\r\nsteam systems, but attention would have to be devoted to steam generators\r\nand controls. Piston expander maintenance would be similar to present diesel\r\nengine blocks, but would be much less for a turbine. Maintenance costs for a\r\ndiesel, however, may rise sharply if pollution control devices are added and if\r\nsophisticated chemical treatment is needed to reduce oxides of nitrogen.\r\ni \'\r\nLnstallation 8; Aswciates Demonstrati011\r\nBus.\r\nE h ; n \" r - , > C i.

County are asked to supplement or guarantee a portion of the\r\n$649 million bond isue.\r\nThe immediate need for rapid transit is the same in both areas.\r\nI Live In An Area Not Near Enough To The Rapid Transit System To Use It.\r\nHow Will The Program Help Me?\r\nNearly all communities in Southern California are tied together by ribbons of concrete\r\nwhich are the streets and freeways. Over these arteries the essentials of life must flow.\r\nThe life blood of the community can be slowed or halted by any hardening of these arteries\r\n- any congestion which effects the movement of goods and people is hardening of the traffic\r\narteries.\r\nBecause most of the essential goods and the greatest number of workers pass through or\r\ninto the central core of this vast highway network, the congestion at the core affects all of\r\nthe movements in all of the highways.\r\nDelays in deliveries of goods cause an increase in the cost of commodities in every community\r\nand delays to workers who live in those communities - and must travel over highwaysrepresents\r\nlost man-hours.\r\nMeasuring the dollar cost of congestion in any area is extremely difficult, but some efforts\r\nhave been made. San Francisco analysts estimate that during the rush hour in three Bay\r\narea counties alone, 150,000 man-hours are now lost to highway congestion on the average\r\nwork day. In Pittsburgh, it is estimated that a 10-minute delay in traffic means a productive\r\ntime loss of $222,000 at basic steel wages. The National Retail Dry Goods Assn. calculates\r\nvery roughly that the annual cost of congestion in New York City is $1 billion.\r\nSo the principal way rapid transit can help an area dependent upon highways and freeways\r\nfor its mobility is by removing the economic drag of congestion.\r\nIs The Monorail To The Airport A Part Of The Rapid Transit System?\r\nNo.\r\nIt is a separate program. The Goodell Monorail firm is presently working with M·T·A\r\nengineers and other public agencies with a view toward establishing a route and cost of\r\nconstruction and methods for financing.\r\nThe airport type monorail is of special design, with low capacity vehicles for high speed\r\npoint-to-point operation.\r\nMonorail has shown no advantage when compared to other proven systems for high capacity\r\nurban rapid transit routes.\r\nWrite to your representative in Sacramento. Chambers of Commerce, Service Clubs, and\r\nother civic groups can get behind the M·T·A which was established to build a rapid transit\r\nsystem for the area.\r\nNaturally, the congested center, the core of our metropolitan complex, must be attacked\r\nfirst, just as the foundation of a building must be built first. Surface transportation, autos,\r\nand buses will be able to move faster and more freely once the rapid transit arteries have\r\nbeen constructed. Extensions to the system would be added as passenger potential develops\r\nthrough population growth.\r\nSome Questions ...\r\nSome Answers!\r\nWhy Do We Need Rapid Transit?\r\nTo insure maximum mobility for the metropolitan area by relieving the freeways and surface\r\nstreets of a part of the traffic load. Traffic and congestion which clog our streets will choke\r\nour economic lives.\r\nThe alternative would be to add many more traffic lanes through the congested areas. One\r\nrapid transit line can carryover 30,000 people an hour in one direction; about twelve lanes\r\nof super highways (3 8-lane freeways) or 36 arterial street lanes would be needed to do\r\nthe same job.\r\nRapid transit is needed to insure the growth of the metropolitan area and its prosperity.\r\nWhy Are Taxes Necessary?\r\nThe M·T·A has explored fully all other possible avenues of financing. In 1962 a bill was\r\nintroduced into Congress to establish an agency which would guarantee revenue bondssold\r\nto private investors - bonds which would finance construction of the first segment of\r\nthe total transit system (the Backbone Route).\r\nThis was the only portion (through the Central Business District, West Los Angeles, and\r\nBeverly Hills with its high-rise building growth then east to EI Monte) which would pay\r\nfor rapid transit construction and operation through the fare box revenues.\r\nThe balance of the rapid transit network was to be built as and when the passenger potential\r\ndeveloped through growth when it too could pay its own way.\r\nAid was also sought from other governmental agencies to finance the construction of a\r\nSkyline Route to Long Beach and possible later extensions into the San Fernando Valley.\r\nThis request was denied.\r\nBut, the urgency for relief prevails. The emergency is now!\r\nThe people of the County who will find relief from traffic congestion must expect to pay a\r\nsmall portion of the construction costs for a rapid transit system.\r\nThe largest portion of the initial construction cost plus operating expenses will be paid\r\nthrough revenues from the fare box.\r\nWhat Is The Difference Between The Plan For Los Angeles And The Plan\r\nFor San Francisco Bay District?\r\nThe voters of the three northern counties - San Francisco, Contra Costa, and Alamedarecently\r\napproved a Bond issue of $792 million to be paid for out of property taxes. This\r\nis the amount needed to build their 75-mile rapid transit systems\' Trans-Bay tube and equipment.\r\nThe estimated tax rate is to be 67¢ per $100 of assessed valuation.\r\nThe Legislature of the State of California will be asked to pass enabling legislation applying\r\ntaxes to property in Los Angeles County not to exceed 15¢ per $100 of assessed valuation.\r\nTaxpayers of Los Angeles County are asked to supplement the revenues of the system to\r\nretire a bond issue which will be sold to private investors.\r\nRAPID\r\nTRANSIT\r\n... A REALITY\r\nTHE PROGRAM ...\r\nThe immediate passage of enabling legislation will\r\npermit the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transit Authority\r\nto complete engineering and begin construction\r\nof a new 58-mile regional rapid transit system by\r\nJuly 1, 1964, at a maximum monthly cost to the\r\nindividual taxpayer of little more than one gallon\r\nof premium gasoline in the peak year.\r\nThe 58-mile express system, unhampered by crushing\r\npeak hour congestion, accidents, mechanical\r\nbreakdowns or cross traffic, will speed commuters\r\neffortlessly and safely through the central city from\r\nLong Beach to North Hollywood, and West Los\r\nAngeles to EI Monte, releasing the arterial and freeway\r\njam which has promised to stifle freedom of\r\nACTION ...\r\nImmediately following passage of the necessary\r\nurgency enabling legislation in Sacramento, engineering\r\nof the Long Beach and Valley lines will commence,\r\nand the engineering of the West Los Angeles-\r\nEI Monte line will be concluded. The latter was suspended\r\nin July, 1962,due to unavailability of Federal\r\nlegislation which would have permitted the construction\r\nof a 22 mile basic segment totally out of revenue\r\n(the Backbone route). The downtown Los Angeles-\r\nEI Monte line will be completed and in service in\r\nmovement and commerce in the second largest\r\nmetropolitan area in the United States.\r\nThis program will be accomplished with a financial\r\nplan whereby M·T·A transit revenues will be supplemented\r\nby revenues obtained through taxes which\r\nwill not exceed an annual rate of 15 cents per $100\r\nof assessed valuation in Los Angeles County. This\r\ntax, at its peak, would cost the typical Los Angeles\r\nhomeowner (typical assessed property valuation:\r\n$4,000) a few cents more than one gallon of premium\r\ngasoline per month. It would range from 28~ cents\r\nper month in 1965 to a peak of 41 cents per month in\r\n1967, declining thereafter to approximately 19 cents\r\nper month in 1980.\r\nOctober, 1966; Long Beach to downtown Los Angeles,\r\nin time for the World\'s Fair, April, 1967; downtown\r\nLos Angeles to Century City, April, 1967;\r\nCentury City-West Los Angeles, January, 1968; and\r\nWilshire-North Hollywood, July, 1969.\r\nIt is anticipated that a $649 million, 4-percent\r\nbond issue will be placed by a nationwide distributing\r\ngroup in three 40-year term stages: September,\r\n1963, $200 million: January, 1965, $250 million; and\r\nJanuary, 1967, $199 million.\r\nFINANCIAL\r\nFEASIBILITY ...\r\nThe financial feasibility of the program is established\r\nby projections of population and conservative\r\nreal and personal property growth estimates of Los·\r\nAngeles County and projections of revenues available\r\nfrom operations and invested funds.

J. Eyraud. I speak to you as Chairman of the MTA.\r\nThe Authority is a board of seven local citizen members with homes\r\nand businesses spread allover the county. They invest many hours\r\nThey are prominent in community affairs and are well known to\r\nmost of you and they are here today. Fred Dean of Dean Electronics,\r\nLong Beach, is Vice-Chairman and chairman of the MTA Engineering\r\nCommittee; Martin Pollard, Cadillac and General Motors Dealer, San\r\nHall, owner and operator of Radio Station KLAC, is chairman of the\r\nPersonnel Committee; Nat Dumont, Dumont Aviation, is chairman of the\r\nAdvertising, Promotion, and Public Relations Committee; Walter Briggs,\r\nowner of Walt\'s Auto Parks, is chairman of the Retirement and Insurmen\r\nare a Board of Directors operating your public transportation\r\nsystem which carries 3/4 of a million passengers everyday, producing\r\ngross revenues of $42-46 million dollars a year. These dollars pay\r\nThe interests of these men are your interests and the interests of\r\nyour community. -1-\r\n\\\r\nIn 1951, the citizens of the Los Angeles area recognized that\r\nsomething had to be done for the solution of our critical transportation\r\nproblem and requested the Legislature to establish the\r\nAuthority. The proposal had the support of the County Board of\r\nSupervisors and the Los Angeles City Council, and most other pUblic\r\nThe first was to bUy and to operate the existing public transportation\r\nsystems in the area. This has been done. Since 1958,\r\nsame time, other metropolitan areas were heavily subsidized. For\r\nexample, San Francisco, small as it is, is subsidized $5-7 million\r\ndollars a year; New York, $100-150 million dollars a year; the Boston\r\nMTA has almost exactly the same size system as Los Angeles and carries\r\nwithin 5% the same number of passengers that we do in Los Angeles;\r\nyet Boston is subsidized $20-22 million dollars a year.\r\nwhether or not that increase follows cost of living trends, it defeats\r\nthe very purpose of public transportation by driving passengers back\r\nWhen fares were increased more than two years ago to 25¢, there\r\nwere dire predictions that fares would increase again within 60 to\r\nThe fares have ~ot increased in the \'last 2 years, and they will\r\nnot increase in 1963, and hopefully, they will not increase in 1964.\r\nMTA has tailored service to patronage.\r\nMTA has eliminated the competing service of the 3 predecessor\r\ncompanies.\r\nMTA will convert this March from the obsolete and expensive\r\nstreetcar operation to the more flexible, modern, and economical\r\nDreamliner buses.\r\nin Alhambra and Riverside, and, more recently Glendale, to take the\r\nplace of the private companies which went bankrupt. Several weeks\r\nago the MTA initiated an entirely new and improved service for the\r\nwhole San Fernando Valley. Thirty-five route miles were added~ addibasis\r\nin the off-peak hours. The response indicated that many elderly\r\npeople who otherwise would not be able to move around because of the\r\ncost involved were benefiting by the Senior Citizen Program. It is\r\nnow a permanent part of MTA\'s service and fare structure.\r\nThis performance has created a unique situation in the United\r\nStates··-B, public transportation bond selling at a premium of 105 to\r\nl07--establishing a credit record which will greatly assist in the\r\nfinancing and bUilding of the system we will describe to yon today.\r\n-3-\r\n~ow, wnat about that system--mass rapid transit was the second\r\nmajor responsibility given to MTA.\r\nThere have been 30 or more studies over the last 30 years, sponsored\r\nby various pUblic agencies and interested groups. These studies\r\nhave all concluded one thing: we need better public transportation and\r\nmass rapid transit.\r\nMTA aimed its studies and engineering to answering this need.\r\nWe employed outstanding experts in the economics and construction\r\nof mass rapid transit systems. The work of these International experts\r\nanswered these questions: where should we build a system, what kind\r\nof a system should we bUild, and how can we finance it.\r\nThere is no need to take a great deal of your time to try to impress\r\nyou with the critical situation which you already know exists.\r\nYour own experience tells you that there is a problem and your own\r\nintelligence tells you that that problem will create an impossible\r\nsituation as we grow to twice as many people and twice as many\r\nautomobiles.\r\nAt the same time we are presenting this plan to you, Governor\r\nBrown is speaking to the Legislature in Sacramento. I talked to the\r\nGovernor this morning and he will say in that address that urban\r\ncitizens need fast and safe transportation to and from work to lead\r\nfuller lives. He will compliment San Francisco for approving a rapid\r\ntransit system there. He will tell the Legislature that the MTA has\r\ncompleted plans for a 58-mile transit system to serve the area, and\r\nthat during this session, MTA will ask for changes in its Enabling\r\nAct to permit and to clear the way for construction. He will say of\r\nthe MTA plan, and I quote, II I have studied the proposal and I find\r\nit sound. I urge you to approve it. The people of Los Angeles need\r\nit.\"\r\nThe answers are in--the need exists, the system has been developed,\r\nit can be built and it can be financed. It will take time to build\r\nit and so it is urgent.\r\nWe are proud of the work that the Authority has done for you and\r\nwant to present to you now a description of the system and a plan for\r\nfinancing.\r\nI will ask Mr. C. M. Gilliss, Executive Director or MTA, to present\r\nthe details of the system, and I will ask Mr. Gerald Kelly, General\r\nCounsel for MTA, to tell you how we can pay for it.\r\nStatement by C. M. Gilliss, Executive Director, Metropolitan Transit Authority\r\nStatler-Hilton Hotel, January 7, 1963\r\nStatement by C. M. Gilliss, Executive Director, Metropolitan Transit Authority\r\nStatler-Hilton Hotel, January 7, 1963\r\n\"We only wish somebody would cOJXlplete some one of the many proposed\r\nrapid transit lines and put it in operation. tI How many·.times have we, in the public\r\ntransportation business, heard this plea? But these are the words of a prominent\r\nwriter which appeared in the Los Angeles Times on November S, 1888. Since that\r\ntime, the 19th Century version of a rapid transit system was actually built and it\r\nserved well for SO years.\r\nMany of you will remember the shrill whistle in the distance and the\r\nclanging and rumbling of the train as it passed. It served its purpose until a new.\r\nconvenient, and flexible transportation tool, the automobile, began shaping the\r\nliving, working, and travel habits of all of Southern California. Then thousands,:\r\nof new streets laid over the train tracks brought millions of automobiles to impede\r\nthe progress of those wonderful old trains until the system died.\r\nIt was made obsolete in many other ways. For one thing, the remarkable\r\nsuccess of the freeways has taught us that any successful commuter facility must\r\ntravel on its own free right of way. Look too at the almost unbelievable technological\r\nadvancements of the last 20-30 years. They make possible new and fantastic 20th\r\nCentury systems that are hard even to imagine.\r\nThe car. the station, the track structures I will briefly describe to you\r\ntoday are as modern as an orbiting space craft, and could no more be compared to\r\nthe 19th Century train than one can compare the 1963 Thunderbird with the Model T\r\nFord; or the 19th Century Hall of Records on Broadway to the new Hall of Administration.\r\nWhat we will build in Los Angeles is the most modern mass rapid transit\r\nsystem in the whole world.\r\n-1-\r\nOur commuter goes through the unobtrusive subway station entrance on the\r\ncorner and takes the escalator to the brightly lighted, attractively decorated and\r\ntiled mezzanine. He does not need a timetable because trains operate at 90 second\r\nintervals in peak hours.\r\nHe shows his individually coded credit card to the magic-eye fare computer,\r\nis admitted through the turnstile concourse and is taken by escalator quickly to\r\nthe train platform. (A computer tabulating device will automatically record his\r\nentrance and his exit and he will be billed automatically for his total mileage at\r\nthe end of each month.) He has missed his train, but in the time it takes to buy\r\nhis. newspaper, another train is there.\r\nHe enters quickly through one of the several entrance doors in the eightcar\r\ntrain as the train makes its 20- second stop. He seats himself comfortably\r\nin a wide contoured upholstered bucket-type seat. He is aware of the soft background\r\nmusic and the automatic announcement of travel information and station stops.\r\nHe is aware of the bright and beautiful and attractive interior and the diffused air\r\nconditioning without drafts. The flourescent interior light is soft and without bright\r\ncontrasts. The wide and deep windows provide a maximum view from the interior\r\nand through the whole train. They are safety-plate glass, tinted, laminated, and\r\nheat repellent.\r\nOur friend can hear the soft background music or the conversation of his\r\ncompanion because the new vehicle was especially designed for interior quietness.\r\nIt is virtually silent and vibration free. An insulated floor muffles any sounds\r\nfrom the wheel-track contact, and a skirt of special sound-suppressing construction\r\nruns the full length of the train to muffle and restrict the transmission of noise to\r\nthose outside. The trucks are also equipped with vibration-isolating devices. Rubber\r\nins.ulation pads are used throughout the <:onstruction of all the a\"tlxil.ia.ry componenla.\r\n-3-\r\nis\r\nWhether he/a park and ride or a kiss and ride commuter, or whether he\r\nfor he has learned that this new service is as simple to use as his new office elevator,.\r\nand he knows that if he boards th~ train at 8:00 in the morning he can be at his desk by\r\n\'Ihe whole 4-corridor system will be in service by July, 1969.

Every\r\npossible technological development was investigated to assure that the system would\r\nprovide the highest of speeds, operating efficiency, passenger comfort and convenience\r\nas well as engineering flexibility and safety.\r\nThis system is designed, quite frankly, to compete V{iththe autOmobile,\r\nnot for space on the already crowded streets and highways as our buses must do today,\r\nbut to compete with it for passengers during commuter time to relieve those streets\r\nand highways.\r\nAs Mr. Robert Bradford, Chairman of the California Highway Commission,\r\nhas said last week, his highway engineers are estimating highway needs on the\r\nassumption that Los Angeles would join the San Francisco Bay Area in building a\r\nrapid transit system. He went on to say he believes the average ca,lifornia driver\r\nwill take less time getting home from work in 1980 than now; but he emphasizes\r\nthat this depends on one fundamental condition - mass rapid transit in metropolitan\r\nThis system we build, then, must compete in attractiveness and convenience\r\nwith the private automobile in order to relieve the streets and highways of d.\r\nthousands of peak-hour commuters.\r\nThere is a booklet at the door for each of you containing more information\r\nthan time will permit today, but I would like you to take a trip with me now on your\r\nnew system. The employee or the executive in the Tishman Building on Wilshire\r\nBlvd. leaves his office and building at 5 o\'clock.

That will happen also in\r\nLos Angeles.\r\nThe real question comes - who is going to ride it. Whois going to get out\r\nof their car and actually ride a mass rapid transit system. Your opinion and mine\r\nWe have employed also the best independent brains in the world with the\r\ngreatest possible experience in projecting the number of passengers that would use such\r\na facility.

The high construction cost would\r\ndelay the construction of many miles of freeway connecting links needed to complete\r\nthe planned 1980 freeway, and needed to provide access and convenience in areas· .\r\nsuch as the Antelope Valley.\r\nThese freeways are doing the job and more than the freeway planners\r\nexpected but they need help at commuter time. We propose to give the community\r\nthat help in the most modern, attractive, efficient, speedy, silent, and safe system\r\nthat can be designed by the best talents available.\r\nThe system has been laid out. It is the foundation of a total system\r\nwhich can be built and adapted with extensions as the population and traffic make\r\nit desirable.\r\nIt can be built, it must be built --- if not today, it will be built at a later\r\ntime out of sheer desperation. What an opportunity we have to make Los Angeles\r\nthe, most convenient place in the world to live and be in business.\r\nMay I now direct your attention and interest to Mr. Gerald Kelly,\r\nGeneral Counsel of MTA who will answer the important question -··what will it\r\ncost and how do we pay for it.\r\nREMARKS OF GERALD G. KELLY, GENERAL COUNSEL\r\nMETROPOLITAN TRANSI T AUTHORI TY\r\nSt atl er-Hi 1ton Hot el, Los Angel es\r\n12 Noon, January 7, 1963\r\nReti rement of the present $40,000,000 - 5-3/4%\r\nbond issue\r\nIn order to hol dint erest payment s duri ng const ruction to a\r\nminimum, the $649,000,000 issue would be sold at three intervals:\r\n1964 - $200,000,000\r\n1966 - $250,000,000\r\n1968 - $199,000,000\r\nThese bonds woul d have a term of 40 years wi th 4% interest rate.\r\nAs soon as all the bonds are sold, the Authori ty wi 11 have a fixed\r\nannual charge for payment of interest and repayment of principal in the amount\r\nBefore seeki ng legi slati on in Washington 1ast year, the Authori t y\r\nengaged the firm of Coverdal e & Colpi t ts to conduct detailed surveys in order\r\nto arri ve at est i mates of pas senger revenues. The Authority\'s estimates are not\r\nguesses, but rather projections based on carefully marshalled facts. These proj\r\nections show that 260 cars operating on 58 mi les of rapid transit system wi 11\r\nannually travel a total of ll, 870, 000 car miles and conservatively generate\r\n$31, 000, 000 in revenue.\r\nEstimates of expenses, include all operating and maintenance items,\r\nplus an insurance premi urn expense of 2-1/2% of the gross and a depreciation\r\nAfter deducting the total e~pense estimate, there is an annual net of\r\n$20,000,000 available for payment of interest and repayment of principal of the\r\nbonded indebtedness.\r\nThis chart shows the total annual payments for principal and interest,\r\nthe net fund available from operations, the tax fund required to meet the deficiency,\r\nand the estimate of the annual tax rate.\r\nThe maximum tax authority of l5¢ per $100 of assessed valuation when\r\napplied to an average $21, 000 house, which is aesessed at $4, 000, indicates a\r\nmaximum possible payment of $6.00 per year or 50¢ a month.\r\nActually, the rates are considerably lower than the l5¢ authorization.\r\nThe highest cost per average householder is 4l¢ per month. The cost for over\r\none half the life of the bonds, or some 25 years, is 20¢ per month. This result\r\noccurs because the financing cost is fixed a.nd does not inflate. Therefore, as the\r\ntotal of assessable property increases through new construction, the rate reduces.\r\nThe tax supports only the interest and principal payments on the bonds.\r\nAll operating and maintenance expense together with two-thirds of the interest and\r\nprincipal payments are supported by revenues.\r\nCompare this briefly with the recent successful San Francisco financing\r\nof its rapid transit system. The cost of $792,000,000 is not all inclusive. To\r\nthis must be added the rolling equipment cost of $71,000,000 plus $40,594,000 for\r\nthe cost of approaches to the Bay Tube. The San Francisco Authority tax rate will\r\nreach a peak in the ninth year of 67¢ per $100 of assessed valuation and hold at\r\nor near 67¢ for 25 years with no reduction resulting from increases in assessed\r\nvaluations. In other words, the same average householder in San Francisco will\r\npay $27. 00 per year as against $2.40 per year for the same householder for the\r\nsa.me 25-year period in the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transit Authority proposal.\r\nYou may be saying to yourselves - the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transit\r\nAuthority proposal sounds very good when compared to San Francisco, but what if\r\nMTA\'s revenues do not come up to expectations? The l5f maximum was selected\r\nfor this very purpose. For example, if l5~ were levied each year over the 40-year\r\nlife of the bonds, the bond debt would be retired as for 20 years of the life of the bonds\r\nsuch rate would meet all of the bond requirements except $3,000,000 per year, and MTA\'s\r\nbus system alone generates this kind of money.\r\nYou have recently rE:ad of a renewed effort of the administration to obtain\r\npassage of a Federal transportation bill. As proposed, it will be based on grants\r\nunder a 25% - 75% formula --- 25% Federal Funds matched by 75% funds generated\r\nfrom local areas. MTA has no legislative program in this session of the Federal\r\nCongress. It does not intend to ask for Federal grants. However, it will not stand\r\nidly by if a grant program is passed. It will insist upon its share for this great\r\nmetropolitan area. If such a grant program comes about, the 58-mile system will\r\nimmediately be expanded to the extent made pos sible by such a grant.\r\nFrank J. Scheifler\r\nTransportation Assistant superintendp,nt\r\nsan Francisco Municipal Railway\r\nRegional conference\r\nof\r\nAmerican Transit Association\r\nLos Angeles, California\r\nApril 6, 1964\r\nThe answer to this question seems to be an unqualified\r\n\"No\", but other considerations are necessary as to how much,\r\nwhat kind, and by whom.\r\nPublic transit has long been the step-child in plans for\r\nmoving people. Millions and even billions of dollars for the\r\nconstruction of freeways and parkways have been appropriated\r\nfor the movement of private automobiles. As a by-product of\r\nall this construction, parking areas and garages are needed\r\nin the vicinity of the destination of the drivers to store the\r\nautomobiles. These parking garages, generally, do not provide\r\nadequate reservoir space for all the automobiles. The resulting\r\nbacklog, of necessity, goes out to the city street causing\r\ntraffic delays and frayed nerves. This is especially true if\r\nthe ultimate destination is in a downtown, metropolitan area.\r\nThe plans for freeways are all vehicle-oriented, but\r\nrecent proposals indicate that some individuals and agencies\r\nare becoming people-oriented. It has been proven that the most\r\neconomical use of our present valuable roadway space for moving\r\npeople is the mass transit vehicle.\r\nTransit operators have found that freeways are useful\r\ndevices that provide routes for express coaches and they also\r\neffect some money saving in providing a fast dead-head, pull-in\r\nor pull-out trip, but they still remain primarily a route for\r\nthe private automobile.\r\nAssistance to mass transit can be of direct financial\r\naid. The elimination or reduction of the various forms of\r\ntaxes for the private operator or SUbsidizing the operations\r\nof the pu~lic aarriers out of direct ad valorem taxes are the\r\nmain sources of monetary relief. Other means available are\r\nhaving the school district pay the difference between the\r\nregular fare and the reduced student fare, and having the merchants\r\nof a specific area support a ride-shop system. The mass\r\ntransit bill to provide grants for commuter transit facilities\r\nis still under study in congress.\r\nAssistance, other than financial, seems to be easier to\r\nobtain. The united states Government has assisted some companies\r\nwith transit studies to test various ways to attract additional\r\npatronage. These results have been applied to comparative operations\r\nin other parts of the country. The state Government has\r\ncooperated with transit operators by providing passenger loading\r\nbays in the vicinity of freeway service roads and in the case of\r\nthe Bay Area Rapid Transit District, the median strip of the\r\nGrove-Shafter freeway will be used for the rapid transit trains.\r\nThe City Government, through the cooperation of the various\r\nagencies, can provide many means of expediting traffic --\r\nexclusive transit lanes, towaway streets, good signal timing.\r\nThe San Francisco Municipal Railway has had the experience\r\nthat the downtown interests, the largest taxpaying group in the\r\nCity, have consistently opposed an increase of the present l5~\r\nfare. Their reasoning is that to maintain a vibrant downtown\r\narea the most economical way is to maintain a low fare to\r\nencourage people to use the transit vehicles, and make up the\r\ndeficit through taxes.\r\nThe voters of the San Francisco Bay Area answered the\r\nquestion of the topic of this talk with a resounding \"No\" as\r\n62% of the electorate approved the rapid transit plans to the\r\ntune of $792,000,000.\r\nplanners have been giving serious thought to providing\r\ntransit some assistance in the form of exclusive transit\r\nstreets. San Francisco is now studying various ways Market\r\nStreet can be restored after rapid transit finishes the construction\r\nof the sUbway. The plans range from making Market Street\r\ninto a pedestrian mall with a roadway of three traffic lanes for\r\ntransit and emergency vehicles only, to a wide vehicular street\r\nwith three lanes of traffic in each direction.\r\nMass transit must compete for its patronage with the automobile\r\nand until it can provide a product with comfort, c0nvenience\r\nand cost comparative to the automobile many people will\r\ncontinue to join the daily traffic jam with their private automobiles.\r\nCommunities must give whatever assistance is necessary to\r\nprovide mass transit the means by which it can compete with the\r\nautomobile or the resulting chaos from choked traffic arteries\r\nwill gradually deteriorate the life blood of the community.\r\nA.2 t05 A.ngeIes HeraId-fXIminer H* Friday, Dec. 28, 1962\r\nChoked in Own Traffic?\r\nCalif.

BROWN\r\nGovernor\r\nQuotes\r\nREFLECTING THE\r\nURGENCY\r\nFOR IMMEDIATE ACTION\r\nThe following quotes have been extracted from\r\nstatements of public officials, businessmen, civic\r\nleaders and association executives - all interested in\r\nbringing mobility to the nation\'s urban areas.\r\nRichard Carpenter, executive director, League of California Cities ...\r\n\"An integrated transportation system requires a high degree of cooperation\r\non the part of cities, counties, the state, private agencies and the public.\"\r\nHarrison A. Williams Jr., United States Senator, New Jersey ...\r\n\"Most of our metropolitan areas, which are the economic backbone of the\r\nnation, are already in the throes of an urban transportation crisis of traffic\r\ncongestion and near paralysis during rush hours. By 1975, the number of\r\nvehicles on the road is expected to rise from the current level of 65 million to\r\nmore than 100 million. The impact of this development will be staggering if,\r\nat the same time, mass transportation services decline another 38 per cent,\r\nas they have in the last 10 years. The result is likely to be either the complete\r\nstrangulation of our metropolitan area or an expenditure for urban highways\r\nat a fantastically higher rate than presently anticipated.\"\r\nDr. A. J. Hagen-Smit, California Institute of Technology ...\r\n\"It is not enough to have a slightly improved, outmoded bus system. What\r\nwe need is a highly flexible system of rapid transit, which is so convenient\r\nand frequent that almost everyone wants to leave his car at home. He will\r\nsave his nerves and his pocket-book-and perhaps even his life.\"\r\nPhilip M. Hauser, head, Population Research Center, University of Chicago ...\r\n\" ... public transit systems are the solution to the problem of moving people\r\nwithin the metropolis. We are learning this the hard way-but mass population\r\nand space considerations alone indicate that learn it we will.\"\r\nDr. Tully C. Knoles, Chancellor, College of the Pacific ...\r\n\"One of the most ridiculous things in American life is to stand by the highway\r\nnear a great industrial center or a university and watch the cars goby; each\r\nwith only a single passenger. We have given up mass transportation in favor\r\nof an individual transportation which is extremely expensive and very dangerous-\r\nand which California cannot afford, either financially or physically.\"\r\nWilliam R. MacDougall, general counsel and manager, County Supervisors Association\r\nof California ...\r\n\"An integrated program must be developed which will include state freeways,\r\ncounty highways, city streets, bus systems and the long-awaited rapid transit\r\n... We have a problem which calls for a new type of effective cooperation of\r\nthe local governmentR.\"\r\nEditorial in the Temple City TIMES ...\r\n\"If we don\'t have some kind of rapid transit system in this second largest\r\nmetropolitan center of the western hemisphere, what will we have? Chaos,\r\npossibly. \"\r\n\"Whether we like it or not, all of us in Los Angeles County are tied in one\r\nway or another with the rest of the area and any proposal which would serve\r\nin any way to alleviate traffic problems and move people from one place to\r\nanother rapidly and efficiently, deserves close attention because these plans\r\nare in our best interests.\"\r\nEditorial in the Los Angeles MIRROR NEWS ...\r\n\"It is pretty generally agreed that we must develop a satisfactory rapid mass\r\ntransit system, or face the spread of traffic-choked blighted areas all over the\r\nmetropolitan district.\"\r\nThe Legislature of the State of California, in Senate Concurrent Resolution 57 of 1959 ...\r\n\" ... all state and local governmental agencies ... are hereby urged to cooperate\r\nvoluntarily ... in planning and developing public transportation facilities to the\r\nend that optimum safety, convenience, efficiency, and economy in the movement\r\nof people in the metropolitan areas may be achieved.\"\r\nThe California Legislature\'s Joint Interim Committee on Highway Problems ...\r\n\"In the long run, with the metropolitan area growth in prospect in California,\r\nit seems likely that freeways and rapid transit will both be required to accommodate\r\nthe expanded economy and the social and cultural demands of the\r\npeople.\"\r\nR. M. Shillito, general manager, Downtown Business Men\'s Association of Los Angeles ...\r\n\"The DBMA is most concerned about the total future transportation-traffic,\r\ntransit, parking-pattern of Downtown Los Angeles ... We conclude (from\r\nanalysis of discussion at the State Chamber\'s Metropolitan Transportation\r\nConference) that (1) the metropolitan area\'s foremost problem is transportation,\r\n(2) there is a general agreement on the need for integrated transportation,\r\n(3) there is a difference of opinion on ways and means to attack the problem,\r\n(4) there is an urgency, for time is running out, (5) legislation will be forthcoming\r\nbecause the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transit Authority as a State\r\nagency is under a mandate to advance a program, and (6) business and\r\ngovernment have expressed a desire to cooperate.\"\r\nSouthern California Research Council ...\r\n\"Completion of the freeway system in Southern California will not solve the\r\nmass transportation problem of the Metropolis. Freeways and individual passenger\r\ncars simply cannot handle peak hour commuter movements. With\r\nnearly 12 million persons and eight million motor vehicles in the Los Angeles\r\nMetropolitan Area by 1980, other forms of public transportation must be\r\ndevised to complement the freeway system.\"\r\nJ. C. Womack, State Highway Engineer, California ...\r\n\"We are deeply concerned with the urban transportation problem. (There is)\r\nfull awareness of the urgency of an early solution ... We are ready not only\r\nto bend over the drafting table but also to sit around the conference table\r\nwith any rapid transit district or other public agency to work jointly toward\r\nsolutions in the public interest, limited only by our legal obligations.\"\r\nL. A. Highway Official Says\r\nFreeways Will Not Solve Congestion\r\n\"Freeways will only help, not entirely solve, the urban transportation\r\nproblem.\"\r\n\"Parking and transit must no longer be treated as step-children.\"\r\nThose two statements keynoted the speech of S. S. Taylor, general manager\r\nof the Los Angeles Department of Traffic, before the recent annual meeting in\r\nSan Francisco of the American Association of State Highway Officials.\r\n\"An important inter-relationship exists between streets, freeways and mass\r\ntransportation,\" Taylor told the highway officials. \"These two systems should\r\nnot exert uncoordinated competition for the taxpayer\'s dollar.\r\n\"The solution of the commuter problem in large cities lies in discovering\r\nthat complementary system of streets, freeways and transit lines which will\r\nmost effectively promote and serve a truly functional pattern of land use.\"\r\nTaylor cited Los Angeles as a city primarily dependent upon motor vehicles\r\nfor transportation. Because of this, he added, the question of land use is\r\ncritical.\r\n\"Already,\" he said, \"approximately 28 per cent of the land area comprising\r\ndowntown Los Angeles is in streets, freeways and service ways, and another\r\n38 per cent is in the off-street vehicular parking and loading.\" Thus, about\r\ntwo-thirds of the land is primarily devoted to rubber (motor vehicles).\r\n\"One freeway interchange in Los Angeles is consuming approximately 80\r\nacres of land area, and each average mile of freeway is requiring about 24\r\nacres.\r\n\"One-third or more of our entire urban area is already required for transportation\r\nfacilities.\r\n\"Ultimately it appears that Los Angeles will have a freeway network forming\r\na city of square giant blocks with approximately four miles of freeway\r\non each side. Within these 16 square mile areas, and unifying them, an\r\nintegrated transportation system must operate or they will plow under the\r\ngoose that lays the golden egg, destroying the city they were meant to serve,\r\nits productivity and the traffic revenues therefrom.\"\r\nTaylor said it will not be feasible to provide sufficient traffic lanes in some\r\nsections of the freeway system to satisfy traffic volumes predicted for the\r\nnext 20 years.\r\n\"The \'excess traffic\' in 1980 - which must be carried by the surface street\r\nsystem or mass transit - is estimated at greater than the total present day\r\nvolumes,\" Taylor said. \"Therefore, in 1980, metropolitan Los Angeles, even\r\nwith approximately 900 miles of anticipated freeways and 300 miles of expressways\r\nin operation, may well have worse traffic conditions than exist today -\r\nnnlf\'ss we provide relief beyond the freeways.\"\r\n- Reproduced fromsan Francisco 8lly Area Rapid Transi t District publ ication, December. 1958\r\n1962 ...\r\nA YEAR OF\r\nRAPID TRANSIT\r\nACTION\r\nSAN FRANCISCO\r\nNovember 9: Bay Area voters OK $792,000,000 rapid transit system with 67¢ tax rate for 40-year\r\nperiod.

BATE, CHIEF ENGINEER\r\nTO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\r\nLOS ANGELES METROPOLITAN TRAFFIC ASSOCIATION\r\nA word or two regarding this SUPPLEMENTAL STUDY OF\r\nMASS TRANSPORTATION -- CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT,\r\nIn a previous report titled \'\'EXPRESS BUSES ON FREEWAYS\"\r\nit was stated that the development of freeways for coach\r\noperation is economically feasible in that such operation\r\nwould provide service much sooner to a greater portion of\r\nthe area than could otherwise be realized. The freeways\r\nare being built. They serve the major centers in the\r\nmetropolitan area. They provide cross-town travel. We\r\nsho~ed the tremendous savings in time which could be\r\neffected with a system of this type.\r\nHOWEVER -- there is one weak link in the program. After\r\nthe buses leave the freeways and co-mingle\r\nwith all the other forms of traffic on the\r\nsurface streets in the Central Business District\r\nconsiderable of the time savings and\r\nother benefits are lessened or otherwise\r\neffected.\r\nTHEREFORE, we herewith submit further studies -- limited,\r\nof course, because of lack of funds, staff,\r\nand time -- of the mass transportation problem\r\nin the Central Business District developed along\r\nsuch phases as seem essential now.\r\n~\r\nIV I . .,rALTE~SMI::::: nager\r\nSTREET ARCADES • . • • • .

There are several examples of arcaded sidewalks in\r\nEurope, but the buildings were generally built with the arcades in them,\r\nrather than changed to that form later as an inexpensive means of widening\r\na street. In New York City the arcading of streets has been advocated for\r\nover 20 years as a method of street widening, but only two sidewalk arcades\r\nhave been built in that time. The first was in the New York Telephone Company\r\nBuilding and the other in the ?l \\Vest Street Building, both in downtown\r\nManhattan; in each case the arcades were part of the original construction\r\nof the building.*\r\nSatisfactory application of the principle of arcading would require setback\r\non both sides of the street -- arcading one side only, the extra lane\r\ngained would throw traffic movement permanently off balance; or to take\r\ntwo lanes, apnroximately 11 ft. per lane, from one side of the street would\r\ncreate serious condemnation and damage problems to the business and property\r\naffected.\r\nUnder normal traffic conditions, it is estimated that approximately 600 cars\r\nper hour per lane could be moved -- an increase of 1200 cars per hour for\r\nboth lanes. As a relief for traffic congestion, widening of street fails\r\nbecause as soon as the street is widened more and more cars averaging one\r\nand one-half persons per car would be attracted to that particular street\r\nand we would be right back in the same traffic congestion mess.\r\nRecent street widenings outside the central business district point up the\r\ncosts of such improvements:\r\n1946 Olympic Blvd, Parkview to \\vestern 1.23 mi. $ 293,no\r\n1947 Olympic Blvd, Los Angeles to Flower .40 mi. $ 114,717\r\n1947 Daly Street, Pasadena Ave to N. Main .72 mi. ~ 229,290\r\n1949 Colorado Blvd, Townsend to Eagle RodkAv .76 mi. $ 327,648\r\nIt nee~s no intensive engineering study to show there are no comparable\r\ncosts for the central business district.\r\nThe world\'s first commercial installation of climbing or moving sidewalks --\r\ntrade-named \"Speedwalk\" -- was placed in operation this year by Hudson and\r\nManhattan Railroad in Jersey City, N.J. This human carrier consists of a\r\nwide conveyor belt, reversible in direction to handle peak loads, and fitted\r\nwith hand rails. Designed by Goodyear and Stephens-Adamson l.lfg.Company of\r\nAurora, Illinois, and Los Angeles, it moves at half normal walking speed and\r\ncan transport close to 11,000 persons per hour up or down a 10 per cent incline\r\nfor a distance of 227 ft.\r\nAdaptability of this type of system to our central business district to\r\nrelieve pedestrian problem intersections might well be the subject of a\r\nstudy by our traffic engire ers. We are informed *that Cincinnati is\r\nconsidering a speedwalk in its business area and a large southwestern\r\ncity is contemplating a moving sidewalk which \'·ould move thru major department\r\nstores and office buildings. Another southeastern city is\r\nlooking into the possibility of establishing a five-block moving siJewalk\r\nwhich would transfer people from parking lots on the perimeter of\r\nits downto\\Vllarea into the heart of the city.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Arcading not recommended for the central business district.\r\nBenefits derived would not justify expense. Improvements\r\nof this type would involve large scale widening of entire\r\nlength of street, or streets, necessitating heavy expense\r\nof rights-of-way and extensive alterations to buildings,\r\nsome of them limit height.\r\nSPECIAL STREET LANE FOR BUSSES -- Setting aside the curb lane for use\r\nof buses and restricting certain\r\nstreets exclusively to mass transit.\r\nMass transit is a vital public service essential to the life of a city.\r\nThe big problem: what can be done to attract more riders to the mass\r\ntransit system, thus reduce the number of private automobiles with corresponding\r\nsubsidence in traffic congestion. Primarily we are concerned\r\nwith the movement of people, not the number of vehicles. A modern\r\nbus transports 60 persons. On the local ratio of 1.5 persons per car,\r\nto transport these same 60 ~ersons by private automobile would add 40\r\nvehicles to the rush hour traffic congestion.\r\nIn other words, a surface lane in the central business district carrying\r\n600 cars per hour, \\~th an occupancy ratio of 1.5 persons, transports\r\nonly only 900 persons, whereas a bus with its carrying capacity of 60\r\npersons, operating 60 buses at one minute headway per hour, transports\r\n3600 persons, or four times as many as by private automobile in the same\r\nperiod of time over the same lane.\r\nRalph E. Gross, Transit and Traffic Engineer, City of Chicago, in a recent\r\nspeech said in part: \"The time is rapidly approaching when, in\r\norder to obtain more efficient street usa~e, ~ass transportation vehicles\r\nwill have to be confined to a particular lane on the street or to designated\r\nspecific streets as mass transportation routes only\".\r\nTHE OCCUP AJ.~TS OF THE 40 AUTOMOBIillS\r\nAVl<:RAGING PERSONS PER CAR IN THIS\r\nPICTURE COULD BE TRANSPORTED IN THE ONE\r\nBUS AND THUS RELIEVE THE TRAFFIC CONGESTION\r\nEXISTING ON THIS STREET.\r\nOCCUPfu~TS l~\r\nResearch does not reveal any specific instance where these two proposals\r\nhave been formally tried thru enactment of an ordinance by any of\r\nthe larger cities. Hmvever, exclusive use of the curb lane by transit\r\nvehicles has been accomplished for all practical purposes in a number\r\nof cities.\r\nThe American Transit Association reports that in cities where they\r\nhave \"No standing - No Stopping\" regulations during peak hour periods,\r\nand where transit vehicles are operated on close headways, motorists\r\ngenerally find it inadvisable to position themselves in the curb lane.\r\nIn places like Newark, New Jersey, on Broad Street practically the entire\r\ncurb area is allocated for bus-stop zones because of the high concentration\r\nof bus routes on the street. This, too, makes for the exclusive\r\nuse of the curb lane by buses.\r\nIn ;\'.filwaukee, where all curb parking is prohibited on the main street,\r\nwhere buses and trolley coaches use mid-block stops with routes assigned\r\nloading zones in alternate blocks, with the high concentration of\r\ntransit vehicles and the high proportion of the curb area allocated for\r\nbus-stop zones, likewise, it is inadvisable in most instances for the\r\nmotorist to position himself in the curb lane.\r\nAn example where both the curb lane and an entire street is given over\r\nto transit operations, for all practical purposes without official\r\ndesgination, can be found in Houston, Texas. This was accomplished by\r\nprohibiting all left and right hand turns for a distance of approximately\r\n14 blocks in the center of downtown and a concentration of routes on\r\nthis main street, making it an almost exclusive transit, pedestrian and\r\nshopper street \'vith automobiles moving to adjacent streets. Once a\r\nmotorist gets on this main street, he cannot get off until he has gone\r\nthe full 14 blocks.\r\nIn the Los Angeles central business district the high concentration\r\nof buses is found on Hill Street. Duri.ng the six hour period (7 to\r\n10 a.m. and 3 to 6 p.m,) Hill at 8th Street carries 1248 buses, adjacent\r\nstreet - Olive at 8th - carries 502 buses, a ratio of 5 buses\r\non Hill to 2 on Olive. During the same period, an average of 4710\r\nautomobiles use Hill Street, with 5266 using Olive Street, or an auto\r\nuse ratio of 1.12 in favor of Olive Street.\r\nLegal questions arise . • •• can the City Council pass a valid ordinance\r\ngrating the exclusive use of a specific street or streets to\r\ntransit vehicles and bar its use to automobiles. \\vedo not propose to\r\nrender a legal opinion here. Section 2, subsection 11 m of the City\r\nCharter reads:\r\n\\I to provide for the acquisition, cons truction, improv.ement or Alteration,\r\nmaintenance, use and control of streets, tunnels, subways,\r\nrights-of-way ••• and other public improvements on,\r\nabove or below the surface of land or water. II\r\nHowever, the enactment of any ordinance under the provisions of this\r\ncharter section must be ~easonable and necessary to the public welfare.\r\nIt has been held by the Supreme Court that the regulation of\r\ntraffic on the streets of a city is not one of those municipal affairs\r\nover which the local authorities are given a power superior to that of\r\nthe Legislature. Sections 458 and 459 of the Vehicle Code pertain to\r\nthe powers of local authorities to enact ordinances \\vithin the reasonable\r\nexercise of the police power. Subsection ilL\" of Sec.459 Vehicle\r\nCode would permit the adoption} of a local ordinance IIprohibiting the\r\nuse of particular highways by certain vehicles, except as otherwise\r\nprovided by the Public Utilities Commission pursuant to Art.2 of\r\nChapter 5 of Part 1 of Division I of the Public Utili ties Code\".\r\nCONCLUSION: In view of the legal problems involved and the question\r\nof acceptance by the driving public of such measure, we\r\nrecommend further study be undertaken to resolve these\r\nquestions.\r\nINTERSECTION SEPARATIONS -- Provides for excavation and installation\r\nof escalators or ramps for pedestrians to\r\ncross below the street surface, or installation\r\nof escalators or ramps for crossing\r\nintersections above the street surface.\r\nMost delays to traffic can be traced to conflicts at intersections.\r\nEven under the best of conditions, a busy intersection is always a\r\npoint of congestion. Being subjected to the traffic load of two streets,\r\nthe intersection has to be assigned first to one street and then to the\r\nother.\r\nAs a first step in consideration of any costly method of separating\r\ntraffic conflicts it is, of course, necessary to obtain data as to\r\nneed. Without such technical basis the use of controls may become\r\nexcessive and inefficient, creating confusion and delay.\r\nBridges or tunnels provide the absolute separation desired but are\r\nusually expensive and not always satisfactory. There are a few pedestrian\r\nbridges over streets in New York City, notably those over\r\nWest Street at Liberty and Barclay street ferry terminals, which are\r\nused by large numbers of people.\r\nHerald Square is an outstanding example of underground passages.\r\nHere people can enter a large underground concourse at 16 different\r\nplaces and can go to any of the ot~ r exits, in many places by\r\ncrossing diagonally in the shortest possible line, but this opportunity\r\nis not used as often as it should be. To induce people to\r\nuse these underground ways for crossing the east-west direction,\r\nthere should be at least two escalators, one on the east side of\r\nSixth Avenue at 35th or 34th Street and another on the east side of\r\nBroadway at 33rd or 32nd Street. With these improvements, this underground\r\nconcourse would be used by people crossing thru moving\r\ntraffic, as many do now. This is the best place in the city to demonstrate\r\nthe benefits of improved pedestrian facilities. As a rule,\r\nhowever, people will not use either elevated or sub-surface pedestrian\r\nways unless they have some reason to go to the upper or lower\r\nlevel.it\r\nIn 1926 Los Angeles saw the start of an intensive construction program\r\nof pedestrian subways thru a $350,000 bond issue voted by the\r\npeople. There are now 123 of them in use, their primary purpose is\r\nto serve school children, and their use by children is very high due\r\nto educational programs and traffic safety patrols. Adult use is\r\nlimited -- altho lighted, women will not use them at night. There\r\nare no pedestrian subways located in the central business district\r\nnor are there any overpasses for public use.\r\nA survey conducted in 129 cities of various populations (los Angeles\r\nand Ne\\yYork City excluded) uncovered 253 overpasses or underpasses,\r\nwith only 9 of them in cities over 500,000 population. Overpasses\r\nor underpasses require barriers to force pedestrians to use them and\r\nshould be constructed only where the problem cannot be solved in simpler\r\nand more economical manner. Stairways are found to be quite\r\nobjectionable and ramps or escalators should be substituted.\r\nSchemes and TyPes -- positive separation between pedestrian and vehicular\r\ntraffic may be p chieved by:\r\n1. Overpasses on the four sides of an intersection with up escalators\r\nand down stairways\r\n2. Overpasses in the mid-block area with up escalators and down\r\nstairways and barriers at the intersection to prevent crossing\r\nthe street at all intersections on the pavement level\r\n3. Overpasses in the mid-block area with approach ramps extending\r\nto the intersections each way from the overpass bridge on both\r\nsidesof the streett:\r\n4. Overpasses of street as a part of a continuous elevated sidewalk\r\nextending along entire block at the second street level\r\n- 5 -\r\n*Study by Regional Plan AssocationJ Inc. New York City 1942.\r\n5. Underpasses at the intersections on the four sides of each with\r\nboth up and down escalators\r\n6. Underpasses at subway stations in the~ent of construction of\r\nexpress bus subways in certain streets.\r\n1. Increased speed of movement for the vehicular traffic using\r\nthe central business district streets;\r\n2. Provides steady flow of pedestrians instead of intermittent\r\nflow when the movement must be interrupted to permit exclusive\r\nuse of the intersection by the vehicular movement;\r\n3. Reduction of time required for shoppers to visit all establishments\r\nin the district thus making shopning more attractive\r\nto greater numbers of people;\r\n4. Reduction of accidents at intersections. Records of 54 large\r\ncities have shown that out of a total of 3468 fatal accidents\r\nwhile 53% occurred away from intersections, 25% were at the\r\nintersections. In 6 leading cities, out of 8289 accidents,\r\n912 occurred because of crossing against the signal, 797 in\r\ncrosswalks and 473 crossing with the signal.\r\n\\fuile fatal and non-fatal accident rate at intersections in\r\nthe Los Angeles central traffic district is very low during\r\nthe daylight hours -- traffic moves slowly because of congestion\r\nand because many of the intersections are under officer\r\npatrol -- it is during the night and early morning\r\nhours when the intersections are unpatrolled that the accident\r\nrate piles up.\r\n5. Altho positive separation of pedestrian and vehicular traffic\r\nis likely to cost as much as $280,000 per intersection\r\nfor overcrossing bridges \\rith escalators, the ratio of\r\nbenefits to cost might be as much as 1 to 10.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: In the event bus subways are constructed under certain\r\nstreets in the central busiress district as shown in\r\nstudy plan \"BUS SUBWAYSII of this series, it is recommended\r\nthat as an integral part of such construction,\r\npedestrian underpasses be provided at intersections\r\nand as connections with subway stations; provide\r\nmid-block overpasses with escalators (speedwalks) at\r\nselected locations, and overpasses with lIup\"escalators\r\nand IIdownllstairs at other selected intersections.\r\nThe location and type of facility would be determined\r\nby an engineering and traffic study.\r\nOperation of one-way streets in the Central Business District is in\r\neffect on 5th Street - westbound\r\n6th Street - eastbound\r\n8th Street - westbound\r\n9th Street eastbound\r\nStudy reveals that one-way operation of streets through increasing street\r\ncapacity -- moving larger volumes of traffic with more dispatch and fewer\r\naccidents -- is a great help in relieving traffic congestion through the\r\ndowntown area. In fact, so successful has been this operation that more\r\nstreets have and are being studied for one-way traffic movements. However,\r\nthere are no fixed sets of warrants for one-way streets because\r\nthere are too many variables in street patterns, in traffic flows, physical\r\nconditions and other factors which influence the final decision.\r\nTherefore, conversion must be weighed from the standpoint of public benefits\r\nand who will pay the bill.\r\nAdditional streets studied 3rd Street - westbound\r\n4th Street - eastbound\r\nHistory: Present width of 4th Street, Main to-ros Angeles, 32.7 ft;\r\nLos Angele s to \\;1all36.7 ft, balance 40 ft. or more providing\r\n4 lanes capable of carrying 2400 vehicles per hour. Plans for\r\n4th Street cut connecting ;vithHarbor Freeway call for a 44 ft.\r\nroadway of 4 lanes.\r\nRecommended by Traffic Engineer (Report June 1953):\r\n1) eliminate jog in 4th Street at Alameda;\r\n2) widen 4th Street between Hain and \\vall.\r\nRecommended by City Engineer Lloyd i\\ldrich (Reports April 1952 and July\r\n1953 to Board of Public \'Yorks):\r\n1) jog at Alameda be eliminated\r\n2) 4th Street be widened from :fain to \\l1all,estimated cost $80,300\r\nexclusive of acquisition of property for jog.\r\nThe financing of both of these improvements has been recommended\r\nby Ci ty Engineer to the Board of Public \\\'!orks. It is expected that\r\nfavorable action by said Board and the City Council will be forthcoming\r\nso these two necessary improvements can be completed by the time the\r\n4th Street connection at Harbor Freeway is opened to use about the latter\r\npart of year 1955.\r\n3rd Street is temporarily used for \'one-way movement from Hill\r\nStreet westerly during the F.:;. peak only.\r\n11th Street - westbound\r\n12th Street - eastbound\r\nHistory: 11th Street roadway is 40 ft. Relatively not a heavy traffic\r\nartery because it ends at San Pedro Street and the n\\\\I\" car\r\noperates between Broadway and Figueroa where there is a bad\r\njog which would have to be eliminated at an estimated cost\r\nof $183,000 for acquisition and construction. The \"\\v\" line\r\ncould be rerouted Broadway to Pico to Figueroa, thence south\r\n- 7 -\r\nHistory: 12th Street is a continuous 40 ft. roadway from Hooper Avenue\r\nto Hoover Street. Now carries a heavy volume of traffic --\r\none-way operation \'vould materially increase this. Problem:\r\nrerouting of #2 trolley coach running east from Hain Street\r\nand reconstruction of overhead facilities.\r\nOn the basis of data presented at conferences and discussions early in\r\n1951 it anpeared questionable whether more traffic could be moved if\r\nboth streets were converted to one-way operation. More actual carrying\r\ncapaci ty is avaibble by continuing two-\'vay operation on 11th and oneway\r\noperation on 17th during peak travel periods.\r\n1st Street - westbound\r\n2nd Street - eastbound\r\nHistory: Recommended by former Traffic Engineer Dorsey:\r\nP oint of transition on the wes t \\lould be \'vhere Is t and 2nd\r\nStreets run into Beverly Blvd at Glendale Blvd -- on the east,\r\nat Vignes Street requiring construction of a new roadway in\r\nthe vicinity of Garey to carry the 2nd Street traffic over\r\nFirst Street Viaduct. The IIplI car now operates over First\r\nStreet between Boradway and Vignes Street. Permitting the\r\nwestbound lip\" movement to remain on First Street, Dorsey\r\npointed out that the eastbound movement could be accomplished\r\nby constructing a single track rail on 2nd Street. Recently\r\n1st Street was reconstructed and widened between Main and San\r\nPedro Streets and street car tracks relocated at considerable\r\nexpense. It would, therefore, appear unlikely that rerouting\r\nthe Ifp\" line for eastb0und mowement on 2nd Street ,vith attendant\r\nexpense should be advocated at this time.\r\nFigueroa Street - southbound\r\nFlower \" northbound\r\nHistory: Recommended by Traffic Engineer \'vith southerly transition\r\npoint at 38th Street, northerly at Temple Street.\r\n\\vith the completion of the Harbor Freeway to 23rd Street and\r\nthe diversion of many vehicles from Figueroa Street to the Freeway --\r\nwi th the operation of the \"\\l\" line on Figueroa between 11th and \\vashington\r\n-- it is questionable whether Figueroa should be considered\r\nfurther as a one-way street north of 23rd Street.\r\nComparative counts made before and after the opening of the\r\nHarbor Freeway indicate a decided traffic switch from Figueroa Street\r\nto Harbor Freeway. In 1950 the count on Figueroa at Olympic Blvd was\r\n56,232 -- in 1954, it was 34,934, a drop of 21,298. The first traffic\r\ncount at the Olympic Blvd separation taken in July 1954 showed a combined\r\nnorth and south movement of 66,638 vehicles for a 16 hour period from\r\n6 a.m. to 10 p.~. Also, at 6th Street there was a drop in 1953 of 5313\r\nvehicles on Figueroa Street from a total of 65,021 in 1949.\r\nPending completion of Harbor Freeway to 42nd Street, about November\r\n1955, one-way operation is in effect with Figueroa Street now\r\nserving as the one-way artery for southbound traffic and Flower\r\nStreet for one-way traffic northbound -- both operating between\r\n22nd Street and 38th Street.\r\nMain Street\r\nLos An,geIes\r\nsouthbound\r\nnorthbound\r\nfrom Sunset Blvd to Ivashinp:tonBlvd\r\nfrom 23rd Street to Sunset Blvd\r\nLos Angeles Street varies in road width from 40 to 46 ft. beween\r\n4th and 5th Streets, south of 5th it widens to 56 ft. To\r\nconvert to one-way traffic would necessitate widening to 60 ft.\r\nfrom 1st to 6th Streets.\r\nComplications: merging of two-way traffic on Spring Street with one-way\r\non Main at 9th Street; operation on Main Street of 1. i•• Transit Lines\r\n#47 Coach, #2 trolley bus, and F and #8 car lines (The California Public\r\nUtilities Commission recently authorized the L.i .• Transit Lines to abandon\r\nrail lines F and \"811 on Main Street and substitute bus line #8 in\r\nlieu thereof); Metropolitan Coach Lines #52, #56 and #63 out of the\r\n6th Street terminal northbound. On Los Angeles Street, Metropolitan\r\nCoach Lines operate nine lines soutbound to the 6th &\' Main and 6th &\' Los\r\nAngeles Streets terminals.

There are approximately 3600\r\nbus units entering the district daily and unless a large majority of these\r\ncan be taken off the surface streets and operated over the elevated roadways\r\nlittle relief of the con~estion prnhlpm ~~n the betterment of mass\r\ntransportation can be expected.\r\nCONCLUSIONS -- The practica~ility of a plan to utilize the alleys in the\r\nCentral Business District and construct elevated roadways\r\ntherein for the use of buses in connection with a mass\r\ntransit system operating over the freeways would not be\r\neconomically justified or feasible because of the physical\r\nconditions presently existing in the district.\r\nLessons learned during the war show the degree to which staggering\r\nof business hours can improve traffic conditions during the\r\nmorning and evening peak periods. No other device has been found\r\nthat can spread the traffic load so effectively as staggering\r\nworking and shopping hours.\r\nIt not only improves the load factor of the transit lines, but\r\nthe spreading of traffic peaks proves helpful to all traffic by\r\nreducing congestion and increasing street capacity.\r\nSince the war this practice has been greatly relaxed. To reinstitute\r\nthe program would require careful planning and education,\r\ncollection of statistics and factors \\\"hich can be used to sell\r\nbusiness, industrial, labor and homemakers. This project is of\r\nsuch magnitude and expense it would not be within the budget or\r\nstaff of this Association to undertake study necessary.\r\nCONCLUSION -- Demonstrated benefits of such a progrffinas a\r\nmajor potential for traffic relief are\r\nunquestionable.\r\nThe loading and unloading of trucks at the curbs in the central business\r\ndistrict during the daylight hours create a number of problems, prinipal\r\none being the generation of traffic congestion.\r\nThis problem has always been a challenge -- is becoming more intensified,\r\nand is one that must be handled without seriously handicapping business\r\noperations. iVholesale and retail establishments are economically dependent\r\non both the truck service and the free movement of people on the\r\nstreets.\r\nTo now attempt to provide the necessary off-street loading facilities\r\nfor the many buildings in the downtown district built before the problem\r\nbecame so aggravated would be an expensive undertaking. However, present\r\ncity zoning ordinance orovides that where there is an alley all new\r\nbuildings shall make provision for off-street loading and unloading as\r\nfollows: buildings up to 50,000 sq.ft. - 400 sq.ft. loading facility;\r\nbuildings over 50,000 sq.ft. - 600 sq.ft. loading facility. \\vhere thereis\r\nno alley, facilities are not required. Thus, financial limitations and\r\nabsence of alleys make it impossible to get at the heart of the problem.\r\nUnder the existing Municipal Code, trucks carrying refuse or garbage,\r\nfuel oil or building materials not to be unloaded in the district, and\r\nfreight vehicles with trailer or of certain load and size limitations\r\nare prohibited in the central business district between 7 a.m. and 6 p.m.\r\nAlso said Code bans loading and unloading by com~ercial vehicles on certain\r\nstreets except between the hours 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. These restrictions\r\nare not a solution to the problem -- working hours and labor contracts\r\nare a factor, schedules are difficult to maintain and the cost of\r\ndelays is a large item.\r\nAn excellent example of the voluntary provision :(oroff-street loading\r\nspace is the joint underground facility serving the group of ten office\r\nbuildings in Rock(lfeller Center.-l*\"This facility provides 40 truck\r\nberths capable of serving a total gross floor area of about 7 million\r\nsquare feet. It has not as yet been used to full capacity but its effectiveness\r\nin reducing traffic con£;estion and thus maintaining a highcharacter\r\nbusiness neighborhood is obvious.\r\nCONCLUSION -- The application of such a scheme to a comparable block\r\nor blocks where no alley exists in the central business\r\ndistrict of Los Angeles might be studied. In recognition\r\nof the variable types of businesses conducted,\r\nvariations in their shipping and receiving demands,\r\ncertain factual studies would l1ave to be conducted to\r\ndetermine individual needs before any recommendations\r\ncould be made. Because of the time limit, lack of\r\nfinances for investigating the many ponderables entering\r\ninto the problem, we feel such studies cannot be\r\nundertaken by us at this time.\r\n~~RAFFIC & PARKING STUDY (1942) By Regional Plan Association, Inc.\r\nNew York City.\r\nFringe or perimeter parking calls for a series of parking lots outside\r\nthe central business district with frequent limited-stop bus service\r\nmorning and evening peak hours, convenient, regular service off-peak,\r\nbetween the parking lots and the central business district. Purpose:\r\nto reduce vehicular traffic in the downtown area. To operate successfully,\r\nplan must provide attractive, fast low cost parking-bus transportation,\r\nplus savings in over-all time. The benefits: 1) reduction\r\nof downtown traffic makes available more short-time parking for\r\nshoppers - thus downtown area regains \"lost\" business; 2) shifts\r\nall-day parkers to the fringe lots, speeds up mass transit operations\r\ngenerally; 3) helps maintain high downtown tax base, and 4) increases\r\nefficiency of curb-parking enforcements.\r\nArguments against fringe parking: cost of land in some areas is so\r\nhigh it is questionable whether the lots would be patronzied due to\r\ncorrespop~ing high parking costs plus bus fare -- in Los Angeles\r\npeople use automobiles for convenience and it will take considerable\r\neducation to wean them back to mass transportation carriers transit\r\ncompanies cannot afford to operate low cost shuttle systems on the\r\nbasis of peak hours alone.\r\nOnly to the extent that fringe parking actually keeps traffic out of\r\nthe dO\\Yntown area is it contributing significantly to traffic relief.\r\nInquiry reveals fringe parking experiences in the various ~ities to be:\r\nST.LOUIS. Park-Ride Limited Plan launched Nov.1953. Cars park free on\r\nmunicipal opera lots (2 lots with total capacity of 600 cars,\r\n1 lot of 1000 cars) approx. 5 mi. from downtown; round trip\r\nfare 35¢, I-way 20¢, children under 12 yrs. 10¢; buses\r\noperate on a 5 min. headway during peak, 15 min. during middle\r\nof day. The operation has reached 600 to 800 car capacity\r\nwith about 1000 passengers per day.\r\nNo rental is paid to city but city watchmen to guard the lots\r\nare paid for by the Public Service Co. A personal interview\r\nsurvey was made during the third month of operation by an independent\r\nresearch organization which came up with these interesting\r\nfacts: 1) 70% of park-ride customers formerly made\r\ntheir trips downtown exculsively by auto; 2) of the remining\r\n30%, over one-half said their trips were divided about equally\r\nbetween transit and auto; 3) the worker-shopper ratio is\r\nabout 3 to 2.\r\nThree additional lots have been opened. The first of these,\r\nin northwest St.Louis, was opened in Oct.1954 and is a 700 car\r\nlot about 7! miles from dO\\Yntown. Fare is 40¢ round trip and\r\n10¢ par~ing fee. This operation has been disappointing probably\r\nbecause of its greater distance from downtown and relative\r\ninaccessibility.\r\nThe second new lot is in the North Broadway section and has a\r\n350 car capacity - is about 5 mi. from downtown - fare is 35¢\r\nround trip with free parking. Service has been growing steadily.\r\nThe third new lot was opened Dec.13, 1954 in South St.\r\nLouis - will accommodate 800 cars - drive-in theatre lot about\r\n5 miles from downtown. Round trip fare is 35¢ - 10¢ parking\r\ncharge.\r\nO. \\v. Rexford, Vice-President and Operating Manager of St. Louis\r\nPublic Service Co. had this to say:\r\nlI\\vebelieve that the ideal parking site should not be less than\r\n4 acres in size, accommodating approximately 500 cars. It must,be\r\neasily accessible from main traffic arteries. The terrain must be\r\nsuitable for economical conversion to parking use. Zoning provisions\r\nmust permit the operation and the owners of the site must be\r\ninterested in the possibilities of this use of their land on a\r\nreasonable basis. • • • • • \\ve intend to continue our search for\r\nsuitable locations in other parts of the city because we believe\r\nthe park-ride principle is good public relations. In addition,\r\nit is the first transit operation known to me which has drawn 70%\r\nof its customers from the automobile riding public. As such, it\r\nis an important competitive device for transit in our struggle\r\nagainst the e~clusi ve auto user on downtown streets. II\r\nPHILADELPHIA. PARK & RIDE was established October 1925 at either terminus\r\nof the Market-Frankford Subway Elevated Line, approximately\r\n5 to 8 mi. from center of the city. Recently\r\nenlarged capacity today relieves congested central streets\r\nof apnrox. 1000 cars. All day parking and round trip fare\r\n55¢. Additional park and ride agreements with operators\r\nof existing parking fields, 2 to 8 miles from center of\r\ncity, rate 60 to 70¢, bring total park and ride capacity\r\nto 2680 cars.\r\nBOSTON • Parking lots (adjacent to through highways but outside the\r\nareas where traffic commences to jam) are owned or controlled\r\nby Metropolitan Transit Authority; are operated and managed\r\nby independent parking area operators; 55¢ parking-round trip\r\nticket good only on day of sale.\r\nDALLAS.

If program is successful, additional facilities\r\nwould provide 4000 spaces during fiscal year 1955 -- capable of\r\nfurther expansion to provide a total of 10,000 spaces.\r\nLOS ANGELES. Councilman Ernest E. Debs introduced a resolution in City\r\nCouncil last April \"urging an immediate study to develop a\r\nplan for the creation of periphery parking areas where those\r\npeople who now drive to the downtown area for all-day periods\r\ncould park and enter said area by a feasible, low cost shuttle\r\nsystem, which wQuld open up thousands of parking spaces for\r\npersons making central business section calls of short duration\r\nand divert the flow of traffic around the downtown area instead\r\nof through it\".\r\nIn the Sierra Vista district on Huntington Drive, Metropolitan\r\nCoach Lines have under lease a lot which could accommodate approximately\r\n300 cars but is presently being used by about 100\r\ncars each day. Other locations adjacent to Ramona and Santa\r\nAna Freeways should be studied.\r\nThe parking area at Hollywood Dowl in close proximity to\r\nHollywood Freeway was enlarged last summer by about 1500 cars\r\nso that the entire area can now accommodate approximately\r\n3000 cars. The location of this large lot offers a good opportunity\r\nfor a pilot project. The property is publicly\r\nowned (county) and through a cooperative arrangem nt with the\r\nBowl Association the County and the transit companies a plan\r\ncould be worked out. (See accompanying map of Hollywood Bowl)\r\nCONCLUSImTS -- It appears that the development of fringe parking is\r\ndesirable. Success of such a program depends on\r\nthese basic requirements:\r\n1) an inexpensive parking charge integrated with transit fare\r\n2) sufficient parking capacity to support reasonable frequent\r\nrapid transit service\r\n3) adequate highway or freeway facilities close to parking\r\narea\r\nBiggest problems that must be overcome apnear to be:\r\n1) acqluing land for the parking lot at a price which will permit the\r\nestablishment of a combined parking and transportation charge that\r\nwill be attractive to the motorist. In some cases, this might mean\r\nfree parking on city or authority owned property and possible subsidized\r\nbus service where there is lack of revenue from pick-up\r\nriders not parking on fringe lots;\r\n2) stnategically located 1.5 to 10 miles from center of city preferrably\r\nadjacent to a freeway;\r\n3) providing fast, regularly scheduled transportation from lot to\r\ndOwntO\\Vllarea;\r\n4) educating motorists thru various media as to advantages of fringe\r\nparking;\r\n5) complete cooperation between city, county, state and the transit\r\ncompanies is most essential.\r\nRECOMMENDATION -- To investigate and report on the feasibility of instituting\r\na system of fringe parking lots serviced by buses,\r\nit is recommended a committee be comprised of:\r\nappointed by the Board of Supervi.sors\r\n\" Los Angeles City Council\r\n\" L.A. Bd of Public Uti!. &\' Transporta tion\r\n\" Board of Public iVorks\r\nII California Public Utilities Commission\r\n\" Los Angeles Transit Lines\r\nII Metropoli tan Coach Lines\r\n11 State Division of Highways\r\n\" Los Angeles Metropolitan Traffic Assn.\r\n1member\r\n1 \" 1 \" 1 \" 1 \" 1 \" 1 \" 1 II\r\n1 \"\r\nOf the many plans for the solution of the transit problem, express\r\nbuses on freeways has been concurred in by experienced and well\r\nqualified transit operators and accepted as the one plan which is\r\neconomically feasible and capable of the earliest realization.\r\nSupnlementing our 1953 report -- EXPRESS BUSES ON FREEWAYS -- we\r\nhere\\rith attempt to face the problem of caring for the vehicles in\r\nthe central business district by a system of bus subways.\r\nBut first, a brief examination of some of the characteristics of\r\nthe district is in order: the general spread of improvements now\r\nconstructed or authorized by the voters of the City of Los Angeles\r\nis indicated by a glance at the miles and value of orders on hand\r\nJune 30, 1953. Totals for all divisions and district offices are:\r\nStreet surface improvements\r\nSewers and treatment plants\r\nStorm drains\r\nBridges and structures\r\n337.10\r\n211.63\r\n154.25\r\nValue $ 36,519,000\r\n43,849,000\r\n78,293,000\r\n12,053,000\r\nTOTAL - $170,714,000\r\nFor the last 20 years the total of street improvement (surface),\r\nstorm drains. and culverts, sewers, structures, water systems and ornamental\r\nlighting systems has amounted to $274,787,446. In the fiscal\r\nyear 1950-51 the facilities amounted to $33,605,427 - for 1952-53 the\r\ntotal was $35,663,473, a total for the two years of $69,268,900, or\r\napproximately the amount estimated for a rail rapid transit system in\r\nthe freeways by the Board of Engineers employed by the City in 1945.\r\nThere is probably no better way of judging the size and importance\r\nof leading cities in the country than by presenting such statistical\r\ndata as the above costs of municipal improvements. There has been,\r\nof course, a wide variation in these cC£ts from year to year, and\r\nthis is unavoidable since growth and requirements depend upon many\r\nfactors. In the fiscal year 1933-34, a depression year, costs were\r\nas low as $3,157,456, while in the year 1952-53 they were $35,663,473.\r\nThese rapidly accelerating municipal improvement coSts, largely the\r\nresult of population increases, further emphasize the increasing\r\nnecessity for catching up with traffic facility improvements in the\r\ncentral business district, the official limits of which have long\r\nbeen recognized as Figueroa Street on the west, Sunset Boulevard on\r\nthe north, Los Angeles Street on the east, and Pico Boulevard on\r\nthe south. Thus far construction of systems of freeways have been\r\nhalted at these boundaries. It is only logical to provide substitutes\r\nfor the freeways through this area, the most practical being by means\r\nof realizably cheap vehicular underground passages, namely bus subways.\r\nSince the plan contemplates the abandonment of some of the older rail\r\nlines, and the industry is capable, able and willing to substitute a\r\nreal system of through buses whenever the community and responsible\r\nleaders of the community get behind them with the necessary support required\r\nto make these improvements, it now becomes necessary to formulate\r\nproposals to accomplish this additional subway phase of the freeway\r\nsystem rapid transit plan.\r\nHow to build them -- Any subway, whether for vehicles or some form of\r\nrail operation, must be carefully des~gned in the \'utmost detail to\r\nfit each condtion encoutered during construction. In general, the socalled\r\n\"cut and cover\" procedure would probably prove most practical\r\nin the central business district. There are several different procedures\r\nwhich may be folbwed. In this preliminary conSideration we have\r\na design in mind which would go forward somewhat as follows:\r\nThe steel columns which would form the supports\r\nfor the deck system would be placed in shafts excavated to the required\r\ndepth and the footing placed in the bottom of the shaft. These columns\r\nwould be spaced about 50 feet apart approximately along the existing\r\ncurb line. Girders \\V\'ouldthen be inserted between the columns in both\r\ndirections, across the street and along the curb line. In this manner\r\nthe main supporting structure or box is formed. In the square so\r\nformed the floor or deck system composed of girders and beams would be\r\ninstalled and when riveted together would receive the reinforced deck\r\nor pavement of concrete.\r\nBy adopting this method of construction, one box\r\ncomposed of four columns and the deck system could be completed and\r\nready for the traffic load before any otrer section need be started.\r\nThus progressively the roadway for an entire block could be completed\r\nbefore any excavating for the subway need be undertaken.\r\nAs to the size of the contracts to be let for\r\nconstruction, there would seem to be a definite advantage in awarding\r\nthe entire system in a single contract. This is for the reason that\r\nmuch of the success of the enterprise depends upon the rapid completion\r\nof the freeway system, and the Hollywood, Harbor, Santa Ana and\r\nOlympic Freeways will constitute the principal entrances from the freeways\r\nto the downtown subway system. Rapid completion by several different\r\ncontractors is not, therefore, of paramount importance and the\r\nwork could proceed in somewhat leisurely fashion with finish scheduled\r\ncoincidentally with the Olympic Freeway south of the central business\r\ndistrict. In addition, the project contemplates depositing the excavated\r\nmaterial produced by subway construction in the fills which will\r\ncompose the embankment for the Olympic Freeway. Thus it is of some\r\nimportance to have the Olympic Free~y and the bus subway undertaking\r\nproceed simultaneously.\r\nSubway Street Pattern -- The streets selected in this preliminary\r\nconsideration of the subway pattern in the central business district\r\ninclude two principal north-south streets and four east-west streets.\r\nThe map included in this section of the report shows the north-south\r\nsubways located in both Hill Street and Spring Street. From north\r\nto south the east-west streets are First, Fourth, Seventh Streets and\r\nOlympic Boulevard. In addition, the subway terminal tunnel and the\r\noverhead structure east of the Pacific Electric Building will be\r\nutilized.\r\nWhile there were a very considerable number of studies made in\r\narriving at the pattern shown, the use of Hill and Spring Streets was\r\nthought to provide the most satisfactory plan since the principal area\r\nto be served is considered to be that portion of the central business\r\ndistrict between Los Angeles Street and Grand Avenue. The selection\r\nof the east-west streets has been upon the basis of equal area between\r\nSunset and Pico Boulevards, the adopted streets being three blocks apart\r\nthroughout the length of the district.\r\nIt is probably important that in the subsequent detailed study\r\nof the proposed bus subway system in the downtown area, special attention\r\nwill be required to the feature of desirability and adequacy\r\nof the general arrangement from the standpoint of existing travel\r\nhabits of transit passengers. In this connection it should be emphasized\r\nthat the study will require more information as to the dest1nation\r\nof passengers now being loaded and unloaded along the various\r\nstreets than is given in this tentative preliminary discussion.\r\nThe primary objective of this present report is to reach an\r\narea of agreement upon the basic idea of extending the freeway system\r\nthrough the central business district in the form or relatively inexpensive\r\nvehicular subways. It is, of course, recognized that any\r\nform of subway in an area which has reached the stage of development\r\nnow present in the dO\\intown section of Los Angeres will cost a rather\r\nsizable amount of money.\r\nCost Estimates -- No itemized estimate of cost for the system has been\r\nundertaken for this preliminary report. However,\r\nfrom informa tion available at t his time an approximation\r\nof the total aupears to be on the order of\r\n$40,000,000.00.\r\nEstimated Use -- In the year 1953 the number of persons entering the\r\ncentral business district, \\vithin ,,,hichwe have shown the proposed bus\r\nsubway system, was 211,300. This number crossed the cordon bounded\r\nby Sunset Blvd, Los Angeles Street, Pico Blvd, and Figueroa Street by\r\npublic transportation during a normal 12 hour week day. Approximately\r\n7200 public transportation units enter the central business district\r\nin 24 hours. The figure is based on nuormation supplied by the princi~\r\nTED\r\n~ Bus SUBWAY STREET PATTERN\r\n1 PL PROPOSED SUBWAYS\r\n~,\'\\ •• II • II ••••••• I •• II ••• RAMP - SUBWAY TO ELEVATED\r\n_ 18:1l8:I == I8l 1:8:1 I3J I:E:I 18l ~ S;UGGES;TED\r\n~ LEGEND\r\nff~ PROPOSED SUBWAYS\r\n- - - - - - - - - INDICATES CONNECTION TO FREEWAY\r\n.~ , \'\\ II II II ••• II II • • II _ lSI I8l cs:r !8l CB:I I8J I8l I8l ELEVATED STRUCTURE\r\n~. _~ ....==\',=,.. =..==SUBWAY TERMINAL TUNNEL\r\n\r\n\r\npal operators, Pacific Electric Railway Company and Los Angeles Transit\r\nLines. In oqr planning of the subway system we have increased\r\nthis total somewhat because of the relatively few additional lines\r\nwhich enter the district such as the Asbury Lines, Torrance Municipal,\r\nand the like, which would ultimately use the subway system. Also we\r\nhave made allowances for increases which mayibe expected if and \\V\'hen\r\nthe subway system begins operation and for any additions which may result\r\nif it is decided to institute such features as the park and ride\r\nphase referred to in this report.\r\nIt will be observed that there are factors involved in this study of\r\nsubway system capacities which will require much additional study before\r\nany definite overall number of passengers can be determined.\r\nShould it develop that additional subway capacity is required, we\r\nfeel it a matter for future planning and consideration and not one\r\nthat can be even reasonably foretold at this time.\r\nAuthority to Construct -- The authority of the City of Los Angeles to\r\nconstruct subways is contained in the following charter provision:\r\nArt. 1 Sec. 2-l1-(M) Shall have the right and power, subject to the\r\nrestrictions in this charter contained, to provide for the acquisition,\r\nconstruction, improvement or alteration, maintenance, use and control\r\nof streets, tunnels, subways, rights-of-way, public places~ harbors,\r\nsewers, storm drains and other public or local improvements on, above,\r\nor below the surface of the land or water.\r\nAdditional Studies reguired -- The subway structure must be designed\r\nin all its detail. This will require the services of several engineers\r\nfor some time. Accompanying the designing of the subway structure,\r\ndetailed studies must be given to location and construction of\r\nthe subway stations -- specifications for the handling of excavation\r\n\\vork since it will require the examination of all sub-surface condi-.\r\ntions -- bearing capacity of the soils encountered for the supporting\r\ncolumns, and the designing of the whole structure to best advantage\r\nwith reference to existing large sewers, etc.\r\nAll detailed plans must be completed before any contracts can be let\r\nfor the construction of the system. In fact, much of this work must\r\nbe completed before even the detailed estimates of cost can be determined.\r\n\\fuile not considereti particularly difficult the ventilation\r\nfeature must be carefully planned in all its phases. Also plans for\r\nthe drainage of the subways. \\Yhere the subways connect with overhead\r\nstructures as seem likely there will be required the designing of the\r\nforms or falsework. \\fuile this is often left to the contractor awarded\r\nthe work, even in that event arrangements must be made for the\r\nchecking of his plans.\r\nIt is contemplated that the Association will cooperate in the preparation\r\nof the necessary routing maps to show just which lines\r\nwill operate in each of the subways. This can only be satisfactorily\r\naccomplished by a series of illustrations showing the initial\r\nroutes as they can be placed under the existing conditions, followed\r\nby others showing the various steps which will be required as the\r\nchanges in the existing routings or equipment are made. This will\r\nrequire not only a very considerable amount of time but also must\r\ncoincide with the changes as authorized by the regulatory authorities,\r\nwhich it is realized is a phase of the enterprise which cannot be\r\nhurried.\r\nThe preliminary study and the discussion which it is likely to promote\r\nhave been considered sufficient to justify publication at this\r\ntime. Once the basic idea has been concurred in by agencies and\r\nindividuals concerned, the Association has in mind the preparation\r\nof further detailed report which will form the basis for the preparation\r\nof the detailed plans and specifications to be undertaken\r\nby the anpronriate divisions of the Los Angeles City government.\r\nCONCLUSION -- It is concluded that the highly satisfactory results\r\nof such freeway bus line operation as has been placed\r\nin service fully justify the further planning for\r\nsuch operation on the freeways and the further extension\r\nof the system through the Los Angeles City\r\ncentral business district by means of the relatively\r\ninexpensive vehicular subways herein described.\r\n1111111li~lliiillllilllllliillillrl~ijlilj Ilill~irliflillllill\r\n100000393247\r\n. \'~\"\',\r\nLOS ANGELES~\'?\':&1ffROPOLITANTRAFFIC ASSOCIATION\r\n610 South Main Street • Room 987\r\nLOS ANGELES 14, CALIFORNIA'),(3350,91,2,50,0,'1954 Supplemental Study of Mass Transportation: Express Buses in Subways\r\n '),(3189,92,2,45,0,'Straight Arrow Press'),(3190,92,2,40,0,'1959'),(3191,92,2,42,0,'jpeg'),(3188,92,2,41,0,'Hollywood Babylon is a book by Kenneth Anger.

With wide open spaces and limitless possibilities, thousands of people emigrated to the Los Angeles area. The region attracted many influential modern architects such as John Lautner, Richard Neutra, and Charles Eames. Lautner is remembered for his infamous &ldquo;Chemosphere&rdquo; and &ldquo;Rainbow&rdquo; homes. Both of these homes display Lautner&rsquo;s mastery in building on the steep slopes of the Hollywood Hills and his futuristic vision for the coalescence of architecture with nature. Neutra and Eames were influential architects for the Case Study Houses, an experimental American residential program sponsored by the Arts &amp; Architecture magazine. The end of World War II caused a residential housing boom and the homes of the future needed to be inexpensive and efficient. Neutra, Eames, and several other architects, designed and constructed a series of modern homes as prototypes for postwar housing. Googie architecture is another movement with beginnings rooted in the post World War II era. Googie architecture is a form of modern architecture and was influenced by the car culture, the Space Age, and the Atomic Age. This futuristic style of architecture was popular for coffee houses, gas stations, and motels. Despite falling out of popularity in Los Angeles, Googie architecture is significant. Manifested within futuristic designs of commercial buildings, Googie architecture represents the fascination with the Space Age and the fear that was inspired by the Atomic Age.</p>','Claire Moler',1,1,'',NULL,'futuristic-architecture-in-los');

The Aetherius Society was founded a year later in order to strengthen the bonds between extraterrestrial life forms and the human race in hopes of preventing the annhialiation of the earth, the end of the world.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Society believes in a messianic figure whose arrival on earth will bring a new age of peace. This \"Next Master\" is believed to posess magic that will change eliminate nuclear threats and environmental devastation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Focusing on developing mass stores of healing psychic energy, members of The Aetherius Society interact with \"Spiritual Energy Batteries\" hoping to fend off natural disasters around the world. The society integrates many forms of new age spiritual practices including yoga, mediation and alternative medicine. They also integrate world religions into their theology, believing that spiritual figures from many religions are \"Cosmic Masters\" from disparate planes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Aetherius Society sees the earth as spiritually stagnant; active in anti nuclear and environmental movements, they believe that spiritual healing will cure all problems eventually. Key locations (eighteen mountains) serve as actively charged psychic energy conduits, allowing for closer contact with the \"Cosmic Masters\" and for spiritual recharging.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>These mountains would also serve as a site of rescue for members, if indeed the \"End of Days\" does come. The Aetherius Society\'s millenarian attitude shares certain qualities with Christian apocalypticism in addition to its new age teachings, operating on a base of moral guides to living as dictated by George Kings communication with the \"Cosmic Masters.\" In addition, The Aetherius Society maintains a paranoid stance towards a group dubbed The Silence Group, whose main purpose is to suppress and/or provide disinformation about the attempts of the \"Cosmic Masters\" to communicate with world leaders and governments.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The organization was founded in Los Angeles and maintains one of its two headquarters there.

Van Tassel was an aircraft mechanic and flight inspector who worked at Lockheed, Hughes Aircraft and Douglas Aircraft. In 1947 he finally abandoned the aerospace industry to live full time in Giant Rock. Eventually there was a small community by Giant Rock that included a ranch, airstrip, cafe and a small home for him and his familiy.</p>\r\n<p>George Van Tassel claimed that he developed a new form of telepathic communication with extraterrestrial beings that utilized both natural human tendencies and advanced forms of alien technology. His method of communication eschewed the more metaphysical and spiiritual underpinnings that many other UFO religions founded their theology upon. George Van Tassel was convinced that anyone with the right technology and training would be able to communicate with extraterrestrials just as he had.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Many of Van Tassel\'s earlier messages were from the specific being, Ashtar, who focused on apocalyptic visions as the logical consequence of the development of the hydrogen bomb and nuclear technology. Van Tassel attempted to communicate with various government agencies in order to pass on this information from Ashtar so as to prevent catastrophe.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Van Tassel announced his exchanges with Ashtar at a yearly convention by his home called the Giant Rock Spacecraft Convention.</p>\r\n<p>The Ashtar Command was said to be an alien government, a government active in supporting its citizens. Some channelers in the Giant Rock community claimed a future in which the Ashtar Command would descend to earth to guide its people. After Van Tassel\'s death, the group was unable to remain unified, and Ashtar is claimed as a force or being in many different groups, religions and theologies.</p>\r\n<p>In 1953, Van Tassel claimed that he was woken up in the middle of the night by a Venusian who taught him the technique for rejuvenating the human body. A year later, Van Tassel began constructing the Integratron in Landers, California in order to facilitate this process. The Integratron was meant to serve as a research center for both the advancement of spiritual and scientific technology aimed at understanding the bounds of time and extending the human life. The structure was never fully completed, Van Tassel died of a sudden heart attack before its official opening. It exists in its incomplete form and is open for visitors to partake in sound baths for the purposes of rejuvenation. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong></p>\r\n<p>I Rode a Flying Saucer by George Van Tassel&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>When Stars Look Down by George Van Tassel</p>\r\n<p>UFOs and Popular Culture ed.

Ron Hubbard. The world headquarters of the religion, Gold Base, is located in Riverside, California. Pacific Area Command Base (PAC Base) is located in Hollywood, California as well as the Celebrity Centre and several museums and operating churches and educational centers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>L. Ron Hubbard had been operating the Hubbard Association of Scientologists International (HASI) since 1952 in addition to selling Scientolgy books and products. After extending the reach of Scientology to religious domains in a bulletin to members of Scientology, the official first Church of Scientology opened its doors in 1954 in Los Angeles.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The church\'s founder is treated by the church in hagiographic terms, matching the way he depicted himself as a larger than life, multi talented individual. Much of his self reported life history has been disputed and even disproved, but he claimed to be a world traveler, explorer, nuclear physicist, photographer, musician, philosopher and naval officer.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Hubbard was responsible for developing the belief systems, practices and infrastructure that form Scientology which grew out of Dianetics which was more of a self help system. Scientology is invested in the belief that humans are immortal spiritual beings who have been alienated from their original nature. A method of spiritual rehabilitation, enacted through a form of counseling called auditing, forces participants to relive painful and traumatic events in the past in order to break themselves free of their limitations. These counseling sessions are paid for by members on an increasing scale as one moves through the world of Scientology.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In their belief system, a human is an immortal alien spirit being, a thetan,trapped on Earth in the present form. Much of the specific church doctrine is not available to the public, as different levels of knowledge are accessed as you move through different levels of Scientology\'s processes. Internal documents have been leaked and the church has come under scrutiny with these public revelations.</p>\r\n<p>Historically, Scientology has had many controversial events within different contexts. Notoriously the church has engaged in harassment of its opponents as well as large numbers of lawsuits against government bodies and agencies in order to silence both its critics and challengers. Several Scientology members were convicted in Operation Snow White in 1979 which still stands as the largest theft of government documents in United States HIstory. Scientologists have also been convicted of tampering with witnesses and espionage in other countries. There have also been numerous instances in which the treatment of members and possible defectors has been questioned as abusive or illegal.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Scientologists are active proselytizers, handing out information on street corners and welcoming anyone into their buildings for free introductory auditing services, career and life assesments or counseling.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong></p>\r\n<p>Bare Faced Messiah by Russell Miller</p>\r\n<p>The Biography of L.

Its operations were run out of the Agape Lodge #1. Agape Lodge #2 was founded in Pasadena, California in 1935 under the guidance of Aleister Crowley. Aleister Crowley was an English occultist, mystic, poet and magician. He was the founder of Thelemite philosophy and as such saw himself as a prophet compelled to inform all people about the entrance into the Age of Horus, the last age of earth.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>John \"Jack\" Whiteside Parsons, joined the Agape Lodge in 1941 and headed up the organization through the 1940s. &nbsp;Jack Parsons was a prominent researcher at the California Institute of Technology and one of the founders of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Aerojet Corp. Parsons did foundational resarch on rocket propulsion and liquid fuel rockets.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Parsons met L. Ron Hubbard, who also became involved in the Agape Lodge (although Scientology maintains that Hubbard was sent to the lodge by the government in an attempt to infiltrate the occult group.) and notoriously ran off with a large sum of Parson\'s money as well as his mistress.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Although much of the information that exists is speculation, it is believed that Charles Manson had a brief involvement with the Agape Lodge #2.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Crowley\'s religious principles, imagery and philosophies were incredibly influential culturally and philosophically in many circles. In the work of Kenneth Anger, Crowley\'s philosophies were fused with the popular integration of UFOs/extraterrestrials into new age and experimental philosophical exercises.

Helter Skelter was an apocalyptic war Manson believed would begin due to racial tension between Caucasians and African Americans. Combining his interpretations of the Beatles White Album as well as the Book of Revelation from the New Testament, Charles Manson believed that the safety and prosperity of his family depended upon the consequences of this coming apocalypse. The murders were meant to spark racial tensions, by attempting to frame the African American population for the violence, Manson was hoping to bring on the very apocalypse that would make him and his Family the new leaders on the earth.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In order to prepare his Family members for the impending apocalypse, Manson took them to a house near Canoga Park, not far from Spahn Ranch. He envisioned the Family recording an album that would have within it, the transformative power to spread chaos. He assumed that murders would be met with racialized retaliation. In this end of the world scenario, African Americans would win the race war only to be subsumed by his Family, who would ride out the racial war in a bunker beneath Death Valley.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong></p>\r\n<p>Will You Die for Me? by Charles Watson</p>\r\n<p>The Family by Ed Sanders</p>\r\n<p>Helter Skelter : The True Story of the Manson Murders by Vincent Bugliosi and Curt Gentry</p>\r\n<p>Manson : The Unholy Trail of charlie and the Family by John Gilmore</p>\r\n<p>Charles Manson : Music, Mayhem, Murder by Tommy Udo</p>\r\n<p>The Manson File by Nikolas Schreck</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>','<p>December 16, 1969 LIFE Magazine Cover</p>',1),(132,90,14,'','<p>Charles Manson\'s Interpretation of Revelations</p>',2),(133,88,14,'','<p>Helter Skelter Door at Spahn Ranch</p>',3),(134,NULL,14,'','',4),(135,NULL,14,'','',5),(136,NULL,14,'','',6),(137,NULL,14,'','',7),(138,NULL,14,'','',8),(139,NULL,14,'','',9),(140,NULL,14,'','',10),(141,NULL,14,'','',11),(142,NULL,14,'','',12),(143,NULL,14,'','',13),(144,NULL,14,'','',14),(145,NULL,14,'','',15),(146,NULL,14,'','',16),(147,283,13,'<p><span>After World War II, the privately owned and operated rail transit system (which first began in 1873) was in a state of disrepair and there was little capital available to invest in improvements or rehabilitation.&nbsp; Motorbuses became the affordable alternative and the public raised weak objections to rail line conversions.&nbsp; The last train ran in 1961, from Los Angeles to Long Beach.&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to popular belief, the Pacific Electric system ran a deficit in all but three years of its operation.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>New mass rapid transit plans were proposed as far back as 1925.&nbsp; Proponents were motivated by a keen sense of Los Angeles\' future population growth.&nbsp; This would necessitate imaginative plans for grade separation, both above and below ground, and exclusive rights-of-way to reduce congestion in business districts, maintain system speed and system attractiveness to riders.</span></p>\r\n<p>Source:&nbsp;http://www.metro.net/about/library/archives/visions-studies/mass-rapid-transit-concept-maps/</p>','<h6 class=\"title\">1925 Comprehensive Rapid Transit Plan</h6>',1),(148,293,13,'','<h6 class=\"title\">1933 Report on a Rapid Transit System for Los Angeles, California</h6>',2),(149,285,13,'','<h6 class=\"title\">1945 City of Los Angeles Recommended Program for Improvement of Transportation and Traffic Facilities in the Metropolitan Area</h6>',3),(150,287,13,'','<h6 class=\"title\">1948 Rail Rapid Transit Now!</h6>',4),(151,301,13,'','<h6 class=\"title\">1949 Rapid Transit for Metropolitan Areas and Related Problems</h6>',5),(152,302,13,'','<h6 class=\"title\">1960 Los Angles Metropolitan Transit Authority Progress Report Relating to Initial Consideration of Systems and Routes for a Mass Rapid Transit Program</h6>',6),(153,305,13,'','<h6 class=\"title\">1962 Goodell Monorail Proposal</h6>',7),(154,303,13,'','<h6 class=\"title\">1963 Rapid Transit: A Reality?</h6>',8),(155,284,13,'','<h6 class=\"title\">1963 Alweg Monorail Proposal</h6>',9),(156,NULL,7,'','',10),(157,NULL,7,'','',11),(158,NULL,7,'','',12),(159,NULL,12,'','',10),(160,NULL,12,'','',11),(161,NULL,12,'','',12),(162,104,16,'<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The majority of Charles Eames\'s architectural work was done in St. Louis in the 1930s, however, it was the design of his own house and studio in Santa Monica, California, in 1949 that established his reputation internationally as an architect.

The house also became a pilgrimage spot for architects worldwide. Famous for its unique and clever use of standardized elements, the house became equally famous for Charles and Ray Eames\'s precisely and beautifully arranged collections and still lifes of found objects displayed in the house\'s interior.

The Lovell house became internationally known via photographs published in newspapers, magazines, and books throughout Europe and the United States. The Lovell house was one of the few American examples included in Henry-Russell Hitchcock and Philip Johnson\'s modernist 1932 exhibition, The International Style: Architecture since 1922, which was held at the newly opened Museum of Modern Art in New York City. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When the Lovell house was finished, Neutra went on a world tour, lecturing in Japan and in Europe. Although American building activities were dramatically reduced during the depression years of the 1930s, Neutra was able to enhance his worldwide reputation through a remarkable array of small-scaled buildings, mostly single-family houses and small apartment buildings. His admiration for the machine was displayed in such designs as his own 1932 Los Angeles house (the VDL Research house), the prefabricated metal Beard house (Altadena, 1934), the Plywood Model House (Los Angeles, 1936), and above all his streamline moderne Von Sternberg house (Northridge, 1936), which suggested a beached oceanliner. All of these houses, as well as his other designs of this decade, reveal Neutra\'s efforts toward a fusion of the landscape with the building. &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; During the last years of his life Neutra joined in architectural practice with his son and continued to design, write, and lecture until his death in Wuppertal, Germany. Although his stature as a preeminent modernist was somewhat diminished in the 1960s, his reputation as an exponent of modernism continues as strong as in the 1930s. &nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://dh101.humanities.ucla.edu/DH101Fall12Lab2/archive/files/9f7662a933f09b95ebc672e3d9fade87.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Continue Reading Biography...</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Recommended Websites:</strong></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.neutra.org\" target=\"_blank\">Richard and Dion Neutra Architecture</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://la.curbed.com/tags/richard-neutra\" target=\"_blank\">Curbed: Los Angeles - Richard Neutra&nbsp;</a></p>\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading on Richard Neutra:</strong></p>\r\n<p><span>McCoy, Esther. <em>Richard Neutra</em>.

In some ways, the Space Age, or Googie, architecture and design surrounding the park blurred the line between the Magic Kingdom and the real world.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>The Space Age Inn, Satellite Shopland and the ultra-modern Bob\'s Big Boy restaurant were like extensions of the promise of Disney\'s Tomorrowland. Likewise, a giant tiki with glowing eyes standing before the Pitcairn Motel was nearly as intriguing to young visitors as the restless natives hiding in the jungles of Adventureland.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>These are some of the more exotic examples of Googie, a style of architecture that thrived in the 1950s and early 1960s. It began as commercial architecture designed to make the most of strip shopping centers and other roadside locations. It fit the needs of the new California \"car culture\" and the dreams of the even newer space age.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Googie began in Southern California, and although it spread (in numerous forms) across the nation, its heart always remained in its birthplace. Los Angeles and Orange County, California remain some of the best places to see what remains of the style.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Googie has also been known as Populuxe, Doo-Wop, Coffee Shop Modern, Jet Age, Space Age and Chinese Modern. In some cases it has been grouped with its cousin, Tiki architecture. It is also sometimes identified as part of a larger overall movement of space-age industrial design. Googie often seems like a joint design by the Jetsons and the Flintstones.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><strong>The Origins of Googie</strong></span></p>\r\n<p><span>Alan Hess, the author of </span><span>Googie: Fifties Coffeeshop Architecture</span><span>, traces Googie back to three Coffee Dan\'s restaurants designed by John Lautner in the early forties.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>\"He selected the vaults and glass walls and trusses and angles of his buildings to fit the original, often unusual, concepts of space he favored,\" writes Hess.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Lautner originated the style that would be refined and reinterpreted by many others. Unintentionally, he also gave the style a name when, in 1949, he designed Googie\'s coffee shop at the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Crescent Heights in Los Angeles.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Professor Douglas Haskell of Yale was driving through Los Angeles when he and architectural photographer Julius Shulman came upon Googie\'s. \"Stop the car!\" Haskell yelled. \"This is Googie architecture.\" While Haskell was dubious about the style, he made the name \"Googie architecture\" stick by using it in a 1952 article in <em>House and Home</em> magazine. Unfortunately, the term soon came to be a slur in \"serious\" architectural circles.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><strong>The Symbols and Metaphors of Googie</strong></span></p>\r\n<p><span>Googie, with its extremes, metaphorical qualities and humor has always been hard to categorize. This may have been partly why \"serious architects\" had trouble taking it seriously while the masses seemed to love it.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Googie architecture and design was art that told a story. The story had many variations, but its general plot was always something like this:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Man left his caves and grass huts and through hard work and ingenuity has built an amazing modern world. Tomorrow he will conquer any remaining problems and colonize the rest of the galaxy. However, for all his achievements and modern science man will never lose touch with the natural world and his noble roots.</span>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>The themes of history and primitive man were expressed in buildings and decor that reflected the Old West, the South Seas and even caves. (The interest in South Pacific motifs was partially a result of World War II servicemen returning from tours of duty in that region.)</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Man\'s continuing link to nature was expressed in a number of ways, including the common use of rock and fake rock (flagcrete) walls, lush landscaping, indoor gardens, and vast plate glass windows that broke down traditional barriers between inside and outside. In the world of Googie, it\'s not uncommon to see UFO-shaped buildings with one rock wall, three glass walls and palm trees growing straight up through a cutout shape in an overhanging roof.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><strong>The Elements of Googie</strong></span></p>\r\n<p><span>Various designers and architects represented the theme of man\'s utopian future in many ways. Like obscenity, Googie is hard to define, but we know it when we see it. Some of the more common elements include the following:</span></p>\r\n<p><span><strong>Upswept Roofs</strong> -- This was especially common in the prototypical Googie buildings: coffee shops. An upswept roof allowed larger glass windows up front. Sometimes these roofs also incorporated the boomerang shape. Either way, it made many buildings look as though they were about to take off and fly. Variations on this style included the parabolic roofs of early Bob\'s Big Boy restaurants, designed by Armet and Davis.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><strong>Large Domes</strong> -- Often made of concrete, this was an exotic new shape for buildings made possible by advances in construction technology. It evoked the environment-controlled space stations and extraterrestrial cities that appeared on the covers of science fiction books and magazines. Some domes were reminiscent of flying saucers. Examples include the Anaheim Convention Center, the Cinerama Dome, and even the glass top of the 1956 prototype Pontiac Firebird.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><strong>Large Sheet Glass Windows</strong> -- These served several purposes. First, a tall glass front made the building itself a living billboard to drivers on the streets outside. This was a major consideration now that car travel was a key element of commerce. Also, the vast windows brought the outside in and made a sunnier brighter atmosphere for those inside. Often, the use of sheet glass with thin but sturdy steel support structures made roofs appear to float.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><strong>Boomerang Shapes</strong> -- This shape appeared in nearly every corner of the design world in the 1950s, and architecture was no exception. It appeared in archways, roadside signs, pools (often called kidney-shaped), and tile mosaics. Outside architecture, the shape was echoed in butterfly chairs, Formica patterns, corporate logos and textile prints. The origins of the boomerang as a symbol of the jet- and space-age is a little hazy, but it may be related to the \"flying wing\" aircraft, the expressionist art of Paul Klee and Joan Miro&acute;, or simply the idea of an arrow shape pointing the way to progress.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><strong>Amoebae Shapes</strong> -- Sister of the boomerang, amoeboid shapes were amorphous blobs that appeared in many places, including roadside signs. Some suggest that these blobs were the predecessors of the boomerang. Some have also speculated that this design element came from World War II air defense camouflage patterns.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><strong>Atomic Models</strong> -- This design element appeared in everything from sculpture and roadsigns to dinnerware patterns and household appliances. The interlocking rings of the atomic model were a symbol of man\'s scientific ingenuity and represented the unlimited power that would make our future utopia possible. It also doubled as an (inaccurate) model of the solar system.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><strong>Starbursts</strong> -- An even more ubiquitous design element than the atomic model, the starburst took many forms. Just as the atomic model was shorthand for the \"innerspace\" scientists were exploring, starbursts were symbolic of the outer space being explored by astronauts. It also implied clean and shining surfaces.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>Exposed steel beams</strong> -- These were usually more about appearance than function, but could serve both purposes. Painted steel I-beams often had <strong>geometric holes </strong>cut in them which served the dual purpose of making them lighter and enhancing their visual similarity to rocket gantries.</p>\r\n<p><span><strong>Flying Saucer Shapes</strong> -- Again, this motif was taken from the movies and covers of science fiction books and magazines. The Space Needle in Seattle, Wash. is an excellent example.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>The Googie Look</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong></strong>Although Googie buildings were often quite different from one another, Douglas Haskell noted that the style had certain rules:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><span>It can look organic, but it must be abstract. \"If it looks like a bird, it must be a geometric bird. It\'s better yet if the house had more than one theme: like an abstract mushroom surmounted by an abstract bird.\"</span></li>\r\n<li><span>Ignore gravity altogether. \"Whenever possible, the building must hang from the sky.\"</span></li>\r\n<li><span>Multiple structural elements. Inclusion is the rule, rather than minimalism.</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><span>New materials, including sheet glass, glass blocks, asbestos, plywood and plastic gave the architect a whole new palette to work with. Other innovations allowed steel and cement to be used in new ways. Suddenly, architects had more elbowroom for their dreams. A room made of plastic could look like a log cabin, a space ship, or almost anything.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><strong>The End of a Dream</strong></span></p>\r\n<p><span>Googie was about the past, the present and the future -- But <em>mostly</em> the future. It was part of the popular culture, which reinforced a unified vision of a utopian future built on mankind\'s work and ingenuity.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Like most art forms that told a story or inspired with optimism, Googie went out of fashion in the mid-1960s. It died when the story of our grand future died in the hearts of Americans.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Ray Bradbury\'s story, <em>The Toynbee Convector</em>, is parable of man\'s need for a unified dream of a better future. The hero of the story says:</span></p>\r\n<p><span><em>\"I was raised in a time, in the sixties, seventies, and eighties, when people had stopped believing in themselves. I saw that disbelief, the reason that no longer gave itself reasons to survive, and was moved, depressed and angered by it . . . . Everywhere was professional despair, intellectual ennui, political cynicism . . . . The impossibility of change was the vogue. . . . Bombarded by dark chaff and no bright seed, what sort of harvest was there for man in the latter part of the incredible twentieth century? Forgotten was the moon, forgotten the red landscapes of Mars, the great eye of Jupiter, the stunning rings of Saturn.</em></span></p>\r\n<p><span><em>\"....Life has always been lying to ourselves . . . . to gently lie and prove the lie true to weave dreams and put brains and ideas and flesh and the truly real beneath the dreams. Everything, finally, is a promise. What seems a lie is a ramshackle need, wishing to be born.\"</em></span></p>\r\n<p><span>Why did we stop believing our own promises? For indeed, the death of our dreams and optimism also marked the death of Googie and the space age. Certainly, this is a topic that\'s been flogged to death over the past thirty-some years, but a few of the popular answers follow:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span>The assassination of President Kennedy sparked a national loss of innocence.</span></li>\r\n<li><span>The Vietnam War changed our nation\'s view of itself.</span></li>\r\n<li><span>The Johnson Administration\'s decision to focus on \"Great Society\" programs rather than America\'s great \"rendezvous with destiny.\"</span></li>\r\n<li><span>Baby boomers -- the children of the can-do World War II generation -- hit their late teens and rebelled against their parents\' values.</span></li>\r\n<li><span>As the Space Program progressed, Americans became more sophisticated about space travel and \"futuristic\" technologies. Their view of the \"Space Age\" was de-romanticized.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span>Whatever the reasons, no new Googie was built. However, the existing buildings have served their communities well ever since, as bowling alleys, churches, professional centers, coffee shops, motels, car washes, etc. Even those who grew up in the 1970s and 80s are likely to have fond memories of burgers and milkshakes in space-age restaurants, bowling in themed bowling alleys or seeing an aging depiction of the future in Disney\'s Tomorrowland.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Today, the familiar boomerang arches, tapered columns, cantilevers, parabolas and curved domes are being bulldozed at an alarming rate. These buildings stand at an unfortunate juncture: Not new enough to look modern, yet not old enough to be considered historically significant. As the best examples of the genre disappear, we are loosing not only part of our history, but also the last reminders of our shared dream of a shining future in a better world.</span></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://dh101.humanities.ucla.edu/DH101Fall12Lab2/items/show/163\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Source</span></a></p>','<p><a href=\"http://dh101.humanities.ucla.edu/DH101Fall12Lab2/archive/files/be3b4f335442781f168d22ea0d5f8701.png\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Academy Theater, Los Angeles, CA</span></a></p>\r\n<div><a href=\"http://dh101.humanities.ucla.edu/DH101Fall12Lab2/archive/files/be3b4f335442781f168d22ea0d5f8701.png\" target=\"_blank\"><span><br /></span></a></div>',1),(175,138,21,'','<p><span><a href=\"http://dh101.humanities.ucla.edu/DH101Fall12Lab2/archive/files/185c5c3a365c0845567f3319653be29b.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Theme Building at LAX</a></span></p>',2),(176,18,21,'','<p><a href=\"http://dh101.humanities.ucla.edu/DH101Fall12Lab2/archive/files/226707f47384816d41e881fc159bddaf.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><span>LAX LA</span></a></p>\r\n<div><a href=\"http://dh101.humanities.ucla.edu/DH101Fall12Lab2/archive/files/226707f47384816d41e881fc159bddaf.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><span><br /></span></a></div>',3),(177,140,21,'','<p><a href=\"http://dh101.humanities.ucla.edu/DH101Fall12Lab2/archive/files/b40e806f0ffeca89784df31eaec51667.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Casa de Cadillac on Ventura Boulevard</span></a></p>\r\n<div><a href=\"http://dh101.humanities.ucla.edu/DH101Fall12Lab2/archive/files/b40e806f0ffeca89784df31eaec51667.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><span><br /></span></a></div>',4),(178,141,21,'','<p><a href=\"http://dh101.humanities.ucla.edu/DH101Fall12Lab2/archive/files/f3c16d193663fb0f9c63f5002d140cb9.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Car Wash, San Bernardino, CA</span></a></p>\r\n<div><a href=\"http://dh101.humanities.ucla.edu/DH101Fall12Lab2/archive/files/f3c16d193663fb0f9c63f5002d140cb9.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><span><br /></span></a></div>',5),(179,144,21,'','<p><a href=\"http://dh101.humanities.ucla.edu/DH101Fall12Lab2/archive/files/dfd83f8554956ca34a14c7d1988ac914.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Norms restaurant on La Cienega</span></a></p>\r\n<div><a href=\"http://dh101.humanities.ucla.edu/DH101Fall12Lab2/archive/files/dfd83f8554956ca34a14c7d1988ac914.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><span><br /></span></a></div>',6),(180,143,21,'','<p><a href=\"http://dh101.humanities.ucla.edu/DH101Fall12Lab2/archive/files/3d628a87c9ddbc1b2a8caef6d3b420ad.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Jack Colker Union 96</span></a></p>\r\n<div><a href=\"http://dh101.humanities.ucla.edu/DH101Fall12Lab2/archive/files/3d628a87c9ddbc1b2a8caef6d3b420ad.jpg%20\" target=\"_blank\"><span><br /></span></a></div>',7),(181,148,21,'','<p><a href=\"http://dh101.humanities.ucla.edu/DH101Fall12Lab2/archive/files/87fc645ca98c9b1c69fa0477c26cc773.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Norms Restaurant on La Cienega</span></a></p>\r\n<div><a href=\"http://dh101.humanities.ucla.edu/DH101Fall12Lab2/archive/files/87fc645ca98c9b1c69fa0477c26cc773.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><span><br /></span></a></div>',8),(182,146,21,'','<p><a href=\"http://dh101.humanities.ucla.edu/DH101Fall12Lab2/archive/files/f45bc3c5a93082979a7a314e2da8450b.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Brunswick Covina Bowl</a></p>',9),(183,228,22,'<p><strong>Introduction to The Case Study Program (1945 - 1966)</strong></p>\r\n<p>The Case Study House program (1945-66) was an exceptional, innovative event in the history of American architecture and remains unique to this day. The Los Angeles area program oversaw the design of 36 prototype homes, sought to make available plans for modern residences that could be easily and cheaply constructed during the postwar building boom.&nbsp;<span>The first six houses were built by 1948 and attracted more than 350,000 visitors. While not all 36 designs were built, most of those that were constructed were built in Los Angeles.</span></p>\r\n<p>The program\'s chief motivating force was ARTS &amp; ARCHITECTURE editor John Entenza, a champion of modernism who had all the right connections to attract some of architecture\'s greatest talents, such as Richard Neutra, Charles and Ray Eames, and Eero Saarinen. Highly experimental, the program generated houses that were designed to re-define the modern home, and thus had a pronounced influence on architecture - American and international - both during the program\'s existence and even to this day.</p>\r\n<p>Read the announcement published by Arts &amp; Architecture announcing and describing The Case Study House Program: <a

Shulman subsequently mastered the craft of the architectural photograph, using the basics, none more than light. In his iconic images, real and artificial lighting fill space like ether, allowing us to imagine in two dimensions how three-dimensional reality feels. Light paints surfaces; highlights details; provides strong, shadowy contrast, and consequently provides depth and mass.</span>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shulman was a master of light and composition, but his greatest achievement was to win a broad audience for modern architecture in southern California. From 1936 almost until his death, he tirelessly promoted a vision of carefree living in&nbsp;</span>spare, light-filled rooms and beside the pool.

A book on modern architecture without Shulman is inconceivable. Some of his architectural photographs, like the iconic shots of Frank Lloyd Wright\'s or Pierre Koenig\'s remarkable structures, have been published countless times. The brilliance of buildings like those by Charles Eames, as well as those of his close friend, Richard Neutra, was first brought to light by Shulman\'s photography.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The clarity of his work demanded that architectural photography had to be considered as an independent art form. Each Shulman image unites perception and understanding for the buildings and their place in the landscape. The precise compositions reveal not just the architectural ideas behind a building\'s surface, but also the visions and hopes of an entire age. A sense of humanity is always present in his work, even when the human figure is absent from the actual photographs.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Today, a great many of the buildings documented by Shulman have disappeared or been crudely converted, but the thirst for his pioneering images is stronger than ever before.\"</p>\r\n<p>- Peter Gossel</p>\r\n<p><span>Gossel, Peter.&nbsp;</span><em>Julius Shulman: Architecture and Its Photography</em><span>.

He began publishing his work early in life beginning with pamphlets and expanding to his first attempt at a comprehensive project as well as his most enduring work The Secret Teachings of All Ages. The work attempted to provide an introduction to ancient wisdom, the occult and esoteric traditions. Shortly after the publication and successful sales associated with The Secret Teachings of All Ages, Hall founded the Philosophical Research Society in Los Angeles, California in 1934. The school is dedicated to the study of \"religion, mythology, metaphysics and the occult.\" (Quote from the website of the Philsophical Research Society) The PRS operates an archive and a circulating library in addition to its classes.</p>\r\n<p>Manly P. Hall held a lifelong fascination with the Mason and Freemason traditions. He was initiated as a Freemason into Jwewl Lodge No. 374 in San Francisco in September of 1964. He continued with the Scottish Rite Degree a year later. In a ceremony at the Philosophical Research Society, Hall was awarded the highest honor conferred by the Supreme Council of the Scottish Rite, he became a 33 degree Mason.</p>\r\n<p>Halls publications mostly looked towards the past, but he was also always concerned with the future. He saw the vitality of ancient wisdoms in future concerns. As can be seen in one of the included essays his work also traced themes that spoke to current anxieties. His explorations into ancient wisdom yielded his description of the trope of the extraterrestrial. While he emphasized its unique relationship to the economic, technological and cultural moment of Los Angeles in the middle of the twentieth century he also liked to emphasize how these wisdoms could speak to our current anxieties. </p>\r\n<p>Hall was a highly personal and guarded person and despite his very public figure and his many publications, little is known about his personal life</p>\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong></p>\r\n<p>The Secret Teachings of All Ages by Manly P.

It noted that construction of the Southern California freeway system was well underway, and that citizens should seize the moment and embrace the integration of rail lines in the medians of the new highways.\n\nCoordinated by the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, the Rapid Transit Action Group consisted of 17 men (and no women) employed by the State, County, City and independent citizen consultants, as well a representative from Los Angeles Transit Lines and Pacific Electric Railway.\n\nIn its foreward, the Rail Rapid Transit Now! report posed that there were three ways to move people daily in a modern city: by auto, by bus and by rail.\n\nAs “autos are too expensive for most people,” and since autos and buses both congest the streets, it was clear to the Group that rail must be separated from all other traffic when a city becomes as large as Los Angeles\n\nAfter months of studying alternate methods of moving millions of Angelenos, the Group concluded that a new rail rapid transit system was absolutely needed, absolutely viable, absolutely fundable, and absolutely preferable.\n\nThis report stands out in the long line of historic local traffic studies.\n\nSource: http://metroprimaryresources.info/rail-rapid-transit-now-early-freeways-bus-rapid-transit-the-competing-traffic-plans-of-1948/1474/','1948','1954','1947','1953','<kml xmlns=\"http://earth.google.com/kml/2.0\"><Folder><name>OpenLayers export</name><description>Exported on Tue Nov 27 2012 13:06:44 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)</description><Placemark><name>OpenLayers.Feature.Vector_144</name><description>No description available</description><Point><coordinates>-13164061.446467,4034817.4512568</coordinates></Point></Placemark></Folder></kml>',0,100,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,100,NULL,650,'http://dh101.humanities.ucla.edu/DH101Fall12Lab2/archive/files/8c7f2d925b273c96110a17beea751d3f.jpg',1,1,1,NULL,NULL,NULL),(45,137,0,2,NULL,1,'1954 Report to Metropolitan Transit Authority on a Monorail Rapid Transit Line for Los Angeles Map',NULL,'The State formed the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority in 1951 for the purpose of transit planning.

INSERT INTO `omeka_simple_pages_pages` VALUES (1,2,1,1,1,'About','about','<p>Los Angeles has long been fascinated by ideas of its own futurity. The\r\n20th century particularly expressed a set of anxieties concerning the\r\nregion\'s technological and geographic development, beginning in the\r\n1930s and extended through the 1970s (with outliers), as the\r\nmetropolis experienced a drastic expansion in the military and\r\ncorporate aeronautics industry. The city\'s rapid growth began to shape\r\nits urban center and sprout a vast network of suburban communities\r\nthat characterize the surrounding areas. Tensions rose as utopian\r\nvisions of technological innovation, single family homes, and a\r\nseemingly never ending capacity for expansion belied darker threats of\r\nenvironmental degradation, reconstituted communities and impending\r\nnuclear disaster.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This site\'s four exhibits explore these conflicting forces, broadly\r\ninvestigating how they are represented in 1. architectural design, 2.\r\nthe expansion of the aeronautics industry, 3. the state of mass\r\ntransit planning and 4. the rise of several homegrown spiritual and\r\nreligious movements. Such a genealogy provides a window into these\r\nvisions, bounded as they are by the particulars of such an ambitious\r\nand dream-oriented city.\r\n</p>','2012-11-29 20:28:43','2012-10-24 20:06:33',0,0,'',0),(2,7,4,1,0,'Resources & Bibliography','bibliography','<p>Sources used for background research in the construction of these exhibits are listed here under their corresponding exhibit headings.
